                                    sparked modern-day imaginations like the <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span>. 
                                    Viewed as mystical and deadly, they were said to be led 
                                    in <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span> by a charismatic figure known 
                                    as the <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span>.
                                    What can we really know about them?</p>
                        
                                
                                <p>The defining narrative in medieval times about the myth of 
                                    the <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span> (Shaykh al-Jabal) is that of 
                                    <span class="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span>, which was written down in the early fouthteenth century. The account consists of legendary and 
                                    folkloric material that had been spread across the Middle 
                                    East and Europe by Sunni Muslims, <span class="Crusaders">Crusaders</span>, and Jewish, Christian, and Muslim travellers who visited <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span>,

                                    many centuries. He does not name the geographical location of 
                                    the territory of the <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span> – he just names it 
                                    as a country of Mulahet, which he says means ‘heretics’ according to the law of the Saracens. Here 
                                    is a typical passage from <span class="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span>’s account:</p>
                            
                                
                                <blockquote>"The <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man</span> was called in their language <span class="Alaedin">Alaedin</span>… 
                                    He had made in a valley between two 
                                    mountains the biggest and most beautiful garden that was ever seen… There were ladies 
                                    there and damsels, the loveliest in the 
                                    world, unrivalled at playing every sort 
                                    of instrument and at singing and 
                                    dancing. And he gave his men 
                                    to understand that this garden 
                                    was Paradise… No-one ever 
                                    entered the garden except 
                                    those who he wished to make 
                                    <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span>... The <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man</span> kept 
                                    with him at his court all the youths from 
                                    12 to 20… He used to put some of these 
                                    youths in this Paradise four at a time, or 
                                    ten, or twenty… He gave them draughts 
                                    that sent them to sleep on the spot. Then 
                                    he had them taken and put in the garden, 
                                    where they were wakened. When they 
                                    awoke and found themselves in there… 
                                    they believed they were really in Paradise... 
                                    He entices them in a strange manner with such hopes and with promises 
                                    of such pleasures with eternal enjoyment 
                                    that they prefer rather to die than to live. 
                                    Many of them, even when standing on 
                                    a wall, will jump off at his nod or command, and, shattering their skulls, die a 
                                    miserable death."</blockquote>
                                    
                                <p>We have several other medieval accounts –

                                    <span class="GregoryBarHebraeus">Gregory Bar Hebraeus</span> – that offer similar 
                                    stories: this <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span> was 
                                    a mysterious figure who commanded the 
                                    black arts of magic. His followers were said 
                                    to follow no laws, to abuse women, and to 
                                    eat the flesh of swine. The pejorative name 
                                    that they were given, first by Sunni Muslims and then by the <span class="Crusaders">Crusaders</span>, was hashishiyyun; 
                                    it came to mean ‘those who consume <span class="hashish">hashish</span>’. 
                                    In English this word would 
                                    evolve to become <span class="Assassins">assassins</span>.</p>

                                <p>The actual history of the people that would be 
                                    called <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span> begins in <span class="location Egypt" id="Egypt">Egypt</span> in the last years 
                                    of the eleventh century. At that time, <span class="location Egypt" id="Egypt">Egypt</span> was 
                                    ruled by the Fatimid dynasty, who followed 
                                    Isma’ilism, a branch of Shia Islam. In 1094 the 
                                    Fatimid Caliph <span class="ImamAl-Mustansir">Imam Al-Mustansir bi’llah</span> died. 
                                    Although the caliph had wanted his eldest son 
                                    <span class="AbuMansurNizar">Abu Mansur Nizar</span> to succeed him, the vizier 
                                    engineered a palace coup to enthrone a much 
                                    younger son who could be more easily controlled. Nizar and his supporters were able to 
                                    raise an army to fight for the caliphate, but in 
                                    1095 they were defeated in battle. Nizar was 
                                    captured, taken to Cairo, and executed.</p>
                                    
                                
                                <p>However, Nizar’s followers would not accept the new Fatimid ruler, and they pledged 
                                    allegiance to Nizar's son <span class="Al-HadiNizar">Al-Hadi ibn Nizar</span>. 
                                    They would leave <span class="location Egypt" id="Egypt">Egypt</span> and go to Alamut, a 
                                    remote fortress in northern <span class="location Iran" id="Iran">Iran</span>, under the 
                                    leadership of <span class="HasanSabbah">Hasan-i Sabbah</span>, northern <span class="location Iran" id="Iran">Iran</span>,

                                <p><span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> missionaries from <span class="location Iran" id="Iran">Iran</span> began to 
                                    infiltrate <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span> from the early 1100s onwards. 
                                    They tried to spread their message in the 
                                    key cities of Aleppo and Damascus, hoping 
                                    to gain the support of the many other Shia 
                                    communities in the region. After unsuccessful attempts to seize power in these cities, 
                                    the <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> in <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span> withdrew in the 1130s to 
                                    the relative safety of the mountains, heading 
                                    for the area between Lattakieh and Hama. 
                                    There the Syrian <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> displayed a remarkable ability to adapt to a difficult, and indeed 
                                    hostile, environment, and to survive in it as a 
                                    hated and beleaguered minority. They were 
                                    helped, of course, by the fragmentation and 
                                    weakness of <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span> in the years following the 
                                    <span class="FirstCrusade">First Crusade</span>, a situation that lasted until the 
                                    revitalization of the area under the strong 
                                    rule of the two great twelfth-century ‘counter-crusade’ leaders, <span class="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span> 
                                    and <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Just as the <span class="Crusaders">Crusaders</span> in Outremer survived as minorities in the Sunni Muslim-majority
                                    areas of <span class="location Egypt" id="Egypt">Egypt</span>, <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span>, 
                                    and the <span class="location HolyLand" id="HolyLand">Holy Land</span>, 
                                    so too the Syrian <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> within a few decades 
                                    adopted the strategy of occupying existing 
                                    castles or obtaining new ones in under-populated northern <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span> – castles such as Qadmus (1132-3), al-Kahf (1135-6), and, above 
                                    all, Masyaf (1140). It is hard to know how 
                                    many castles they controlled – one historian 
                                    suggests twenty-four, while another believes it was about seventy. Many of these fortifications 
                                    were very close together, forming a virtually 
                                    impregnable zone. Small wonder that the Syrian <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> were able to exercise a political 
                                    influence out of all proportion to their size.</p>

                                    <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> acquired their most famous and longruling leader, <span class="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</span>, the Shaykh 
                                    al-Jabal, the <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span> – a title 
                                    that suggests both noble stock and an aura of 
                                    mystery. He took over the leadership at Masyaf 
                                    in 1169, ruling there for thirty years. He found 
                                    himself in conflict, not only with three Crusader 
                                    states, but also with the strong Sunni Muslim 
                                    military barons <span class="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span> and <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>.</p>
                                    
                                <p>We know a few details about <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span>. 
                                    He was born in Basra and worked as a 
                                    school teacher before becoming a missionary. He was sent from <span class="location Iran" id="Iran">Iran</span> to <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span> in 1162, but took no leadership for seven years. He 
                                    would go on to rule the Syrian <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> community until his death in 1193; during his 
                                    time in power he had acted independently 
                                    of the <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> based in <span class="location Iran" id="Iran">Iran</span>.</p>
                                   
                                
                                <p>We have only one account that tells 
                                    the story of <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span>’s life from the <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> point 
                                    of view. It was written in 1324 by a Syrian 
                                    <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> scholar named <span class="AbuFiras">Abu Firas</span> and is called 
                                    The splendid exploits of <span class="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</span>. 
                                    This account, not surprisingly, is hagiographical, full of legendary anecdotes about <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span>, 
                                    but it also provides factual information corroborated by the chronicles of medieval Sunni Muslim, anti-<span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> writers. The work is a 
                                    fascinating source but it should be used with 
                                    great caution. One passage from it is, however, especially significant:</p>
                                   
                                
                                
                                <blockquote>Many common ignorant fools think that it 
                                    is thanks to his knowledge of magic that 
                                    the Lord <span class="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din</span> practiced these 
                                    marvels. Well, he confounded them all 
                                    and reduced them to silence, not by science or magic but by the force of truth 
                                    and conviction, by his demonstrations 
                                    and by the quotations which he pronounced from Qur’anic verses.</blockquote>

                                <p>Within his community <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> seems 
                                    to have organised his followers with great 
                                    skill. The account of <span class="AbuFiras">Abu Firas</span> describes 
                                    him as possessing extraordinary powers, 
                                    such as clairvoyance, prophecy, and telepathy. He did not need a personal bodyguard, 
                                    ruling by the force of his character 
                                    alone and inspiring devotion and fear alike 
                                    among his subjects. He was a man of few 
                                    words, preferring instead to assume grand 
                                    poses. He was, for example, never seen 
                                    eating, and he cast no reflection in water. 
                                    There are dozens of chapters devoted 
                                    to his seemingly miraculous exploits, 
                                    whether these be escaping assassination attempts against 
                                    himself or being able 
                                    to reply to letters before they 
                                    were even delivered.</p>
                                  
                                
                                <p>From the very beginning of his residence 
                                    in Masyaf, <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> is depicted by <span class="AbuFiras">Abu Firas</span> 
                                    as a mysterious, eccentric personage. 
                                    He arrived in <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span> riding on a white 
                                    donkey and wearing a headdress of 
                                    striped Yemeni wool and shoes he 
                                    had sewn himself. He did not announce himself as the new head 
                                    of the Syrian Nizaris, preferring 
                                    instead to await the death of the 
                                    current incumbent. He would 
                                    remain motionless for hours, 
                                    with his lips mysteriously 
                                    moving but with no sound 
                                    coming out of them. However, despite this portrayal of him, <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> had 
                                    his feet firmly on the ground; for example, he 
                                    positioned pigeon towers on mountaintops 
                                    from which to send messages to the other 
                                    citadels he governed. Clearly, then, he was 
                                    a most formidable charismatic personality, 
                                    and his actions would show him to be a worthy adversary in the struggle for power in the 
                                    medieval Middle East.</p>
                                   
                                <p>It can be assumed with confidence that 
                                    the <span class="Crusaders">Crusaders</span> would not have had the slightest interest in <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> doctrine, 
                                    practice, and 
                                    proselytizing, whilst Sunni Muslims would 
                                    have dismissed their doctrinal details with 
                                    horror and contempt. Given the jihad-saturated atmosphere 
                                    of twelfth-century Muslim 
                                    writings, it is noteworthy that there is, it would eem, no mention of jihad in a <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> context. 
                                    The only allusion to such matters that 
                                    I have found so far are the words of an unknown <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> poet. Referring to the strategy 
                                    of killing high-profile victims, which achieved 
                                    maximum impact at minimal costs to the sect 
                                    – a policy that the Syrian <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> had brought 
                                    with them from <span class="location Iran" id="Iran">Iran</span> and a policy that made 
                                    their name feared both in the Middle East and 
                                    in Europe – the unknown poet writes:</p>
                                   
                                
                                
                                <blockquote>By a single warrior on foot, a king may 
                                    be struck with terror, though he may own 
                                    more than 100,000 horsemen.</blockquote>
                                
                                <p>This interesting line of poetry may well be an 
                                    oblique allusion to the young men called fida’is, 
                                    trained to perform acts of political murder with 
                                    daggers as part of a strategy of intimidation.</p>

                                        <p><span class="UsamaMunqidh">Usama ibn Munqidh</span>, the twelfth-century Syrian warrior and writer, noted that he fought 
                                            against the <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> Isma’ilis on a few occasions. He also recounted this event, which he said 
                                            happened in 1106, where this group used deception to capture the citadel at Apamea:
                                            A group of Isma’ilis from the populace of Apamea endeavoured to take possession of the 
                                            place. They hatched a plot whereby six of them, after having obtained a horse, a mule, some 
                                            Frankish gear, a shield, and a mail hauberk, went out from a region of Aleppo to Apamea with 
                                            all the gear and those animals.
                                            They said to <span class="IbnMula’ib">Ibn Mula’ib</span> (he was a generous and courageous man), ‘We came intending 
                                            to enter your service, and we encountered a Frankish knight and killed him. So we bring you 
                                            his horse, his mule, and his gear.’
                                            And so <span class="IbnMula’ib">Ibn Mula’ib</span> treated them with hospitality and bade them stay in the citadel of 
                                            Apamea in a suite of rooms adjoining the city wall. The Isma’ilis dug a hole in the wall and 
                                            set with the Apameans an appointed time… to strike. The Apameans climbed up through that 
                                            hole, killed <span class="IbnMula’ib">Ibn Mula’ib</span>, and took possession of the citadel of Apamea.</p>

                                <p>It must be admitted that both Crusader and 
                                    Sunni Muslim chroniclers attribute almost 
                                    every murder of important figures to <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span>’s 
                                    fida’is (devoted followers). In a very short 
                                    space of time, their small group caused a degree of fear and paranoia quite out
                                    of proportion to their small numbers.
                                    Perhaps the most famous episodes concerning the <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> of <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span> 
                                    involve the rivalry between <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> and <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>. 
                                    <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s predecessor <span class="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span> had already tried to attack 
                                    <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span>’s territory and had had, according to 
                                    <span class="AbuFiras">Abu Firas</span>, the terrifying experience of finding a dagger on the ground near his head; 
                                    on it he saw the words, “If you do not leave 
                                    tomorrow night, this dagger will be stuck in 
                                    your belly”. But it was <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> who became 
                                    the target of the fiercest hostility, which took 
                                    the form of two attempts on his life soon after 
                                    he arrived in <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span> from Cairo late in 1174.</p>  
                                   
                                
                                <p>Why should <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> have been attacked 
                                    by the <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> so soon after his seizure of 
                                    power in <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span>? In the tough power politics of 
                                    twelfth-century <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span>, the period immediately 
                                    after the death of <span class="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span> presented a very 
                                    good opportunity for <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> to attack <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>, 
                                    a threatening newcomer who was trying to 
                                    grab all the lands that had been carved out 
                                    as an empire by <span class="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span>. <span class="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span> had 
                                    died in 1174, having ruled for twenty-eight 
                                    years. In that time he had never managed to 
                                    achieve any great success against the Nizaris. 
                                    But clearly a new military leader in the form of 
                                    <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> coming from <span class="location Egypt" id="Egypt">Egypt</span> should be stopped before his power became consolidated. 
                                    <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> left <span class="location Egypt" id="Egypt">Egypt</span> and arrived in Damascus in November 1174, under the guise of protecting 
                                    the eleven-year-old son of <span class="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span> from his 
                                    threatening cousins in Mosul. <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> must have 
                                    feared for the survival of the <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> state in 
                                    <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span> when he saw the rising power of <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>; 
                                    this was truly a dangerous enemy.</p>

                                                they do not observe the rites of the Jews 
                                                in all things. They are also men devout in

                                                to their rule. They worship their leader as 
                                                a god and obey him to the death. When 
                                                their prince, who is always called the Old 
                                                Man, as if wise, wishes to kill any prince,

                                                daggers, and the one who is able to obtain it gives thanks to his prince 
                                                and immediately departs to kill the man named. 
                                                Whoever dies in obedience is worshipped 
                                                as an angel. Their life is communal. They 
                                                do not have property. Less than thirty cannot pass a judgment. They have a leader in 
                                                the Far East, who is the head of the order and of their religion. To him they submit 
                                                and him they obey. The Saracens call this 
                                                man the lord of the daggers. They conspire 
                                                against individual princes and this not 
                                                without fault or cause. It is the greatest dishonour for them to kill common people.

                                                alliance with them against <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> and other 
                                                Arabic neighbours, and perhaps they also 
                                                hoped they could be converted to Christianity. The death of <span class="ConradMontferrat">Conrad</span> would immediately 
                                                change the <span class="Crusaders">Crusaders</span>’ opinions, with the <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span> becoming seen as a terrible enemy</p>

                                <p>The first assassination attempt on <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> took place outside the walls of Aleppo 
                                    early in 1175. It is not clear from the sources who instigated this attack. Was the family 
                                    of <span class="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span>, whose territories <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> was 
                                    bent on capturing, involved in this? Or the 
                                    governor of Aleppo, Gümüshtegin? Had one 
                                    of these two parties got in touch with <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span>? 
                                    Or was it <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> alone? The Sunni Muslim 
                                    chronicler <span class="IbnJawzi">Ibn al-Jawzi</span> suggests that the attempts on <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s life were the result of his 
                                    aggression against <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> villages in 1174-5. Whatever the truth, <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> escaped unharmed on this occasion. Quite possibly, it 
                                    was a united initiative from all three parties 
                                    who saw <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> as a dangerous foe, interfering in Syrian affairs.</p>
                                   
                                
                                
                                <p>The second attempt on <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s life 
                                    took place in 1176; it was a much more terrifying incident and it seems likely to have 
                                    come from <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> alone. The following account comes from the chronicle of the Ayyubid 
                                    dynasty by <span class="IbnWasil">Ibn Wasil</span>. During the siege 
                                    of Azaz, <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> was attacked whilst in a tent 
                                    one night reviewing some troops and raising 
                                    their morale. Some Nizaris, wearing military 
                                    apparel, were in the group. One of them 
                                    leapt out of the line and struck <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s head 
                                    with a knife. Had it not been for his helmet 
                                    the sultan would have been killed. <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> 
                                    tried to stop further blows but he could not 
                                    prevent the assailant from striking him again 
                                    and again in his neck, which was, however, 
                                    protected by a chainmail collar. One of <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s 
                                    mamluks appeared and killed the assassin. That was not the end of the incident. 
                                    A second assassin appeared and killed <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s commander Da’ud before being struck 
                                    down himself. Two more <span class="Assassins">assassins</span> then came 
                                    forward; one was killed by <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s brother 
                                    and the fourth, fleeing from the tent, was torn 
                                    to pieces by the crowd.</p>
                                    
                                <p><span class="IbnWasil">Ibn Wasil</span> continues his most unusually 
                                    long narrative of an assassination attempt 
                                    with the following graphic description:</p>
                                   
                                
                                <blockquote>The sultan rode to his tent, terrified by 
                                    this event, with his blood flowing down 
                                    his cheek and the collar of his chainmail 
                                    wet. He hid himself away, took precautions and constructed around his tent 
                                    something resembling a palisade to cover it. He sat in a wooden house, on his 
                                    guard against the soldiery. Those whom 
                                    he did not like (the look of) he sent away 
                                    and those he recognized he allowed in.</blockquote>
                                
                                <p>It is well known that, despite the panegyrics of his biographers 
                                    and his heroic reputation in medieval Europe for generosity and 
                                    chivalric virtues, <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> was capable of 
                                    demonstrating great anger. The famous episode with <span class="ReynaldChatillon">Reynald of Chatillon</span> after Hattin 
                                    in <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s tent is just one example of his 
                                    passionate nature when roused by feelings 
                                    of personal vengeance. And what could be more personal than attacks on his own life? 
                                    So it is not surprising that he sought reprisals against the <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> by besieging their 
                                    centre of operations at Masyaf shortly after 
                                    the second attempt to kill him.</p>
                                   
                                
                                <p>But <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> withdrew after only one 
                                    week of the siege, and thereafter neither he 
                                    nor <span class="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> embarked on aggressive action 
                                    against the other for the rest of their lives. 
                                    They died within a few months of each other 
                                    in 1193. It does indeed seem probable that 
                                    they came to some kind of non-aggression 
                                    pact after Masyaf. After all, <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> had been 
                                    attacked in a terrifying manner on two occasions and was lucky to escape with his life. 
                                    He must have been very fearful of further 
                                    attempts to kill him. Thus the mighty <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span>, the public promoter of Sunni Islam and 
                                    the eradication of heresy, was cornered into 
                                    making a deal with the leader of the hated

                                    Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187 and quickly 
                                    gained a reputation as a capable leader of 
                                    Crusader forces. He also used his political 
                                    connections to gain power in the kingdom, 
                                    and by 1190 he was the de facto king of 
                                    the Crusader state.</p>

                                    the English king Richard I. In April 1192, 
                                    <span class="ConradMontferrat">Conrad</span> was elected the official king of

                                    he could take the throne, he was attacked 
                                    in the city of Tyre on 28 April 1192. The

                                    <span class="ConradMontferrat">Conrad</span>, apparently concluding “that <span class="Saladin">Saladin</span> 
                                    should not have a mind untroubled by the 
                                    Franks, and thus be free to deal with them.”
                                    <span class="IbnAthir">Ibn al-Athir</span> then goes on to offer his 
                                    own account of the assassination:</p>
                                    
                                
                                
                                <blockquote>He sent two men disguised as monks, 
                                    who became associated with the Lord 
                                    of Sidon and Balian’s son the Lord of 
                                    Ramla. They were both with the Marquis in Tyre. The two stayed with them 
                                    for six months, making a show of piety. 
                                    The Marquis became acquainted with 
                                    them and trusted them. On the above 
                                    date (28 April 1192) the Bishop at Tyre 
                                    gave a banquet for the Marquis. He attended, ate his food and drank his wine 
                                    and left. The two Batinis we have mentioned leapt on him and wounded 
                                    him severely. One of them fled 
                                    and entered a church to hide. 
                                    It chanced that the Marquis 
                                    was carried there to have 
                                    his wound bound. This assassin attacked and slew 
                                    him. Both Batinis were 
                                    killed in due course.</blockquote>

                                            <p>In the year 1238 an envoy arrived in Western 
                                                Europe from Islamic lands, said to be sent by 
                                                the <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span> himself. He 
                                                went to the courts of the kings of France and 
                                                England, to warn them of a new threat from 
                                                the East - the Mongols. The envoy warned that 
                                                they must join forces now to face the Mongols, or otherwise both their lands would be 
                                                destroyed. A bishop overheard his plea to the 
                                                King of England, and then declared, “Let us 
                                                leave these dogs to devour one another, that 
                                                they may all be consumed and perish....”</p>
                                                
                                
                                            <p>It would be Eastern Europe that would 
                                                be the first to suffer a Mongol invasion, but 
                                                a clash between the <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> and the Mongols 
                                                was seemingly inevitable. The heirs of 
                                                <span class="GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</span> were seeking to expand their 
                                                empire into the Middle East, and any challenge to their 
                                                control would not be tolerated. Moreover, several other Muslim states 
                                                in the region that had submitted to Mongol rule were calling on Mongke Khan to 
                                                destroy the group. When Mongke heard a 
                                                rumour that the <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> had sent 400 <span class="Assassins">assassins</span> to kill him, he expedited plans against 
                                                them, sending a huge army under his brother Hulagu to the Middle East.</p>
                                                
                                
                                
                                            <p>The Mongol invasion, which started 
                                                around 1253, would slowly conquer various 
                                                <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> castles, but eventually the <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> leader, 
                                                <span class="RuknKhwurshah">Rukn al-Din Khwurshah</span>, was forced to surrender. More fortresses then yielded, 
                                                while others attempted to hold off the Mongols. 
                                                By 1256 the entire region had been 
                                                conquered, and <span class="RuknKhwurshah">Khwurshah</span> along 
                                                with many of his people would be executed. <span class="Ata-MalikJuvayni">Ata-Malik Juvayni</span>, a Muslim 
                                                official who served Hulagu, wrote a 
                                                detailed account of the Mongol campaign in Persia, and even reported 
                                                what he himself took when he went 
                                                into the <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> castles:</p>

                                                while others found refuge in India. In the

                                            <h3><span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> Castle Defences</h3>
                                            
                                            <p>As a threatened minority, the <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> were keen 
                                                to make sure they were protected from their 
                                                neighbours. This is best exemplified by the 
                                                system of fortifications they developed in both 
                                                northern Persia and <span class="location Syria" id="Syria">Syria</span>. By one estimate they 
                                                controlled over 150 castles in these regions, 
                                                almost always in remote and mountainous areas. These castles would be built close enough 
                                                together that they could communicate and 
                                                defend each other. Moreover, the <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> excavated extensive chambers, such as at Alamut, 
                                                for food, water and other supplies to be stored. 
                                                All of these measures made these fortifications 
                                                very difficult to besiege. The fortress of Girdkuh, for example, 
                                                was besieged by the Mongols with 5,000 men. It would take seventeen 
                                                years before it surrendered.</p>
                                              
                                        </div>
                                
                                
                                <p>What emerges from reading the various sources is 
                                    that there is a jumble of 
                                    different versions of who 
                                    may have been involved in 
                                    the killing, somehow conspiring with  <span class="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</span> 
                                    for his followers to carry out the deed. 
                                    Meanwhile, the <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> themselves seemingly never responded to these accusations, 
                                    for it was in their interest to stay silent and 
                                    let their reputation as deadly foes spread 
                                    throughout the region.</p>
                                  
                                
                                <p><span class="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</span> would die in 
                                    1193, but his successors would take on the 
                                    title of <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountains</span>. Their 
                                    small state in the Syrian mountains would 
                                    last until the 1260s, finally being defeated 
                                    by the Mamluk leader <span class="Baybars">Baybars</span>. It was also 
                                    around this time that the Mongols of the 
                                    Ilkhanate conquered the <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> in <span class="location Iran" id="Iran">Iran</span>. 
                                    However, the <span class="Nizari">Nizari</span> Ismaili faith endured, 
                                    despite centuries of oppression, and they 
                                    are now mostly known through the Aga 
                                    Khan, their spiritual leader.</p>
                                    
                                
                                
                                <p>Taking a look back at <span class="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</span> and his followers, 
                                    it is certainly difficult to discern fact from fiction. One must 
                                    keep in mind that the Syrian <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> were 
                                    just a tiny group that were trying to survive in their mountain strongholds, which 
                                    they achieved mostly through alliances and compromises with their neighbours. It was 
                                    more through diplomacy than warfare that 
                                    they endured. Their alleged use of murder 
                                    was exaggerated by their enemies, but this 
                                    was a notion they did not want to dispel, 
                                    for it helped to protect them. Those myths 
                                    around the <span class="Assassins">assassins</span> have endured long after their states were lost, but careful historical research can help to shed further light

                                            <p>The medieval European depiction of the <span class="Nizari">Nizaris</span> as fanatical and licentious has been 
                                                an enduring one. Their portrayals in popular media almost always cast them as villains, 
                                                but there is one notable exception to this: Assassin’s Creed.
                                                Released in 2007, Assassin’s Creed is a video game created by Ubisoft. The story involves 
                                                a modern-day man who is subjected to a machine that allows him to relive the actions of his 
                                                blood ancestors. He soon is taken back to the twelfth century, where he discovers that his 
                                                forebears were members of the <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span>, who have been fighting the evil Knights Templar 
                                                throughout time. The gameplay involves characters stealthily moving across cities and castles, 
                                                using almost superhuman powers. 
                                                The game has the <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span> as the protagonists, but downplays their religious elements. 
                                                Critically acclaimed, <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span>' Creed soon became an international hit, and has spawned 
                                                several sequels. The series of games has sold over a 100 million copies. The story has also 
                                                been adapted into novels, comic books and even a feature film. While the <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span> are still 
                                                portrayed as a mysterious and exotic group, they are at least presented as the ‘good guys’.</p>

                            <p>"When I was in Russia I did not see any Secret Police," said Ameri-
                                can Communist leader Earl Browder in a 1940's debate with Socialist
                                Max Schachtman. "That," said Schachtman, "is the thing about Secret
                                Police. They are secret."</p>   
                            
                            <p>Once anything is made secret or driven underground, statistics and
                                other evidence on the subject are hard to find and often distorted. The
                                case for making <span class="marijuana">marijuana</span> illegal, culminating in the 1937 Federal 
                                <span class="marijuana">Marijuana</span> Tax Act and the passage of Uniform State Narcotic Arts in most
                                states between 1934-1937, was based on almost total public ignorance.
                                In the ten years prior to 1937 only five stories about <span class="marijuana">marijuana</span>, or other
                                Indian <span class="hemp">Hemp</span> derivatives such as <span class="hashish">hashish</span>, were listed in the Reader's
                                Guide to Periodical Literature.</p>
                               
                            <p>But for all the lack of publicity, the congressional hearings in 1937
                                reflect unanimity that America was facing a vast and dangerous threat.
                                Not a single expert or other witness questioned that <span class="marijuana">marijuana</span> often
                                induced violent crimes.</p>
                                
                            
                            <p>But how was this known since "a problem" was not noticeable until
                                the mid-1930's? Only in the 1920's was there any significant usage by
                                even the Mexican-American communities in border cities, and only in the
                                mid and late 1920's did Negro, jazz musicians and "degenerate" bohemian
                                sub-cultures start smoking <span class="marijuana">marijuana</span>. Even the most lurid journalists did
                                not claim that <span class="marijuana">marijuana</span> "seeped" into society at large until the 1930's
                                and usually the mid-1930's.</p>
                              
                            
                            <p>The "evidence" problem could not be met by laboratory studies
                                because the problem was too new, the cause too urgent, and the conse-
                                quence of human subjects too risky. In 1938, the Federal Commissioner
                                of Narcotics opined:</p>
                            
                            <blockquote>Our only way of testing it is to try it on dogs. If the dog's legs get tan-
                                gled up, the drug is potent. If you go on giving the dog <span class="marijuana">marijuana</span>, his
                                brain is destroyed.</blockquote>
                                
                            
                            <p>The few foreign studies were usually too remote in time, place, method of
                                imbibing, and user population to warrant translation. Two hastily conducted surveys 
                                on prisoners yielded contrary results. The Federal Bureau
                                of Narcotics did gather dozens of case histories of probable <span class="marijuana">marijuana</span>-
                                induced violent crimes.</p>
                              
                            
                            <p>Yet no U. S. case seemed so authentic and convincing as the story of
                                the <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span>. <span class="HarryAnsiinger">Harry Ansiinger</span>, Commissioner of the FBN from its incep-

                                disciples are always credulous - and therefore was eager to die or to kill
                                at a word from his master. From these <span class="hashish">hasheesh</span>-eaters, the Arabian
                                name of which is hashshashin, was derived the term "<span class="Assassins">assassin</span>."</blockquote>
                               
                                
                            
                            <p>This story has opposite implications from the one recounted by
                                <span class="HarryAnsiinger"> Ansiinger</span> and others in the 1930's. Rather than killing under 
                                the influence of <span class="hashish">hasheesh</span>, the "<span class="Assassins">assassins</span>" murdered 
                                only after the drug was taken
                                away. The <span class="Assassins">assassins</span> killed for a mellow exotic paradise, not in the throes of
                                mad violence. The killings appear premeditated, not spur-of-the-moment
                                lunacies. The "suggestion" planted in the minds of the devoted killers
                                occurs after the <span class="hashish">hasheesh</span> was consumed, not while it is having an effect.
                                But why believe a single 1912 article in an obscure journal, written
                                by an obviously biased man? Yet, why not? It is obviously time to return

                                men of the district, from twelve to twenty years of age. . . . The <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man</span>
                                used to have these youths put in the garden ... he did it in the
                                following way: he had a potion given them as a result of which they
                                straightaway fell asleep; then he had them taken up and put into the
                                garden, and then awakened. When they awoke . . . (they) so believed
                                that they were really in paradise. And the young ladies and damsels re-
                                mained with them all day . . . and the young men had their pleasure
                                of them. So these youths had all they could desire, and would never have
                                left the place of their own free will. 
                                When the <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man</span>  wanted to send any of his men anywhere to kill
                                some person, he would order the potion to be given to a certain num-
                                ber of them, and once they were asleep, he would have them taken up
                                and brought into his palace. When the youths awoke . . . they would
                                be greatly amazed and by no means pleased. . . . They would now go
                                into the presence of the <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man</span>  . . . believing that they were in the
                                presence of a great Prophet. The <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man</span>  would then ask them whence
                                they came, and they would answer they came from Paradise. The other
                                youths, who had not been there and were present at the narrative, would
                                then be consumed by the desire to go to the Paradise, feeling ready to
                                die in order to be able to do so, and longing for the day when it would
                                come about.</blockquote>
                            
                            
                            <p>The <span class="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> story is unexpected, for even <span class="Robinson">Robinson</span>'s 
                                1912 version is inaccurate, although close. It is not those who have tasted of the
                                <span class="hashish">hashish</span>-tinted paradise who willingly kill but those who have not been
                                there, (just as it is not the sated satyr who kills for sex but the horny
                                "have-not").</p>
                               
                            
                                
                            <p>In fact, close reading of <span class="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> suggests the presence of two
                                drugs: probably an <span class="opiate">opiate</span> used for drugging young men to sleep for
                                purposes of entering and exiting them without their knowledge, and free-
                                flowing conduits of <span class="wine">wine</span>. <span class="hashish">Hashish</span> appears nowhere! 
                                <span class="Robinson">Robinson</span> errs in
                                claiming that <span class="hashish">hasheesh</span> was the "delicious <span class="opiate">opiate</span>" first given the youths,
                                and compounds the error by claiming that normality returns when the
                                <span class="opiate">opiate</span> wears off. In fact, heaven doesn't even begin until the <span class="opiate">opiate</span> wears
                                off, and it ends when the <span class="opiate">opiate</span> is taken again. But at least the 1912
                                version understands that it is not the paradisiacal state which causes 
                                murder but the frustrated desire to return to it.</p>   
                                
                            <p>Given the <span class="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> story there is more reason to call deliberate
                                political-religious murderers "alcoholins" or "opiins" or even "frustratins"
                                than to derive "<span class="Assassins">assassins</span>."</p>
                     
                            <p>But obviously "<span class="Assassins">assassin</span>" has been derived, and 
                                (unless all the translations that I have read miss his mention of <span class="hashish">hashish</span>) 
                                <span class="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> has
                                nothing to do with it. Even if <span class="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> included <span class="hashish">hashish</span> in his descrip-
                                tion of the Assassins, there would be no reason to believe his tale. Yule, a
                                scholar on <span class="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span>, notes that "Romantic as this story is, it seems to
                                be precisely the same that was current all over the East." A leading historian

                            <p>Discarding <span class="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> and turning to modern historians, one finds
                                an Isma'ilite sect established by <span class="HassanbenSabbah">Hassan ben Sabbah</span> in <span class="year1090">1090</span> dubbed
                                Haschischin or <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span> by neighboring Moslems and invading 
                                Crusaders alike. But how evil was this sea and what evidence is there that their
                                foulest deeds were <span class="hashish">hashish</span> induced?</p>
                               
                            
                            <p>First, were the Haschischin so-called because they used <span class="hashish">hashish</span>?
                                Ergo, did they use <span class="hashish">hashish</span> for religious motives? 
                                There are two dissenting views. <span class="EdwardFitzgerald">Edward Fitzgerald</span>, 
                                until his death the leading translator and
                                commentator on <span class="OmarKayyam">OmarKayyam</span>, suggests that Assassin may derive from
                                <span class="HassanbenSabbah">Hassan</span> (The <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man</span>), 
                                not <span class="hashish">hashish</span>. <span class="BernardLewis">Lewis</span> mentions "a Jewish writer
                                in Constantinople in the mid-twelfth century . . . (who) says that the
                                Hashishiyah were so called because they dismissed the things of this world
                                as so much grass (<span class="hashish">hashish</span>)". None the less, the prevailing historical
                                view is that <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span> took <span class="hashish">hashish</span> "in order to induce ecstatic visions of
                                paradise and thereby fortify themselves to face martyrdom."</p>
                             
                            
                            <p>Assuming they probably used <span class="hashish">hashish</span>, I pose the second question:
                                how murderous were the <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span>? From the beginning the followers of
                                <span class="HassanbenSabbah">Hassan</span> had a bad press from neighbors as well as touring Crusaders.</p>

                                complicity with the dreaded <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span>, and even those whose own hands
                                were not clean in this respect did not hesitate to use it.</blockquote>
                               
                            
                            <p>The <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span> were the red-baited victims of their time, analogous to the
                                Tito'ists of 1950 - labelled barbaric murderers by their Western 
                                adversaries and a hated and maligned radical sert by their fellow, if more ortho-
                                dox, members of the larger religious order.</p>
                               
                                
                            <p>True <span class="HassanbenSabbah">Hassan</span> was not a total innocent, but his tactic was not without
                                precedence. Three hundred years before <span class="HassanbenSabbah">Hassan ben Sabbah</span> an Isma'ilite
                                sect had "practiced the strangling of opponents with cords as a religious
                                duty - an obvious reflection of Indian Thugee." Further, "the adjoining  provinces 
                                of Dailam and Azerbaijan had long been centers of extremist
                                heresy, and offered a ready recruiting ground from which al-Hasan formed
                                his corps of fida'is, the fanatical and utterly devoted instruments of his
                                war of terror." Thus, the <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span> seem almost typical for their time and
                                place, and need not have resorted to <span class="hashish">hashish</span> or any other drug. There
                                might even have been reasonable cause for their vicious tactic which
                                "seemed to offer the only effective challenge to the (Crusader) invaders
                                of their country." For a time this made them quite popular with Muslim
                                neighbors. The modern maligning of Hassan hardly seems fitting for this
                                early Freedom-fighter.</p> 
                                
                                
                            <p>But how or where does <span class="hashish">hashish</span> link up with the assassinations? It
                                apparently has no link. "The <span class="Assassins">Assassins</span> were no mere band of hired cut-

                                an essential ingredient of an exquisite paradisiacal beauty, which men
                                were ready and willing to kill and die for. How different is this than the
                                murder one would commit for the love of a beautiful woman? (In Texas,
                                as well as Sicily, such murder was until recently legal as well as 
                                understandable.) Murdering to regain the paradise of either <span class="hashish">hashish</span> or the
                                love of a beautiful woman is based on the scarcity principal. Were love

                                would be merely a fool. Likewise, the mythical <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span> 
                                thrived because of scarcity. Were the joys of <span class="hashish">hashish</span> and paradise on
                                earth available to all, the <span class="OldManMountain">Old Man</span> would be but another forgotten tribal
                                chief, a leader without followers. The lesson for America of the 1930's

                                Trousers were invented by nomads around 1,000 B.C. (to prevent chafed
                                legs) . Trousers became closely identified with barbarians, an imperial edict
                                banned their use by Romans, and even in 1814 the Duke of Wellington
                                was refused to his club because he wore trousers. Though shomelow, the pace
                                of scientific verification seems to be quickening.</p>

                                usage in the U. S. this decade is but one example. An earlier parallel case
                                is that of the tomato:</p>
                               
                            <blockquote>... it was first cultivated to be sold as decoration for the home. Chil-
                                dren were cautioned not to eat them, and those who did were quickly
                                purged by a physician. Later, Italian dandies decided that the tomato
                                spurred the carnal passions, and they started eating tomatoes mixed with
                                garlic and olive oil. The British and French - hearing of this - started
                                gnawing on tomatoes surreptitiously, and eventually the fruit became
                                respectable.</blockquote>

                                    Ethnopharmacological relevance: The <span class="norse">Norse</span> <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> were wild warriors of 
                                    <span class="location Scandinavia" id="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</span> known to enter a
                                    <span class="trance">trance</span>-like state that allowed them to fight with increased strength and a rage that granted them immunity to
                                    many forms of harm in battle. Though many theories have been advanced as to the cause of this state, the most
                                    widely believed is that the intoxicating <span class="mushroom">mushroom</span> <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> was used.
                                    Aim of the study: The following article underlines the issues with this theory and provides an alternate intoxicant
                                    that fits with the reports of <span class="berserkers">berserker</span> behaviour much better: <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span>.
                                    Materials and methods: Literature from a variety of disciplines pertaining to history, toxicology, pharmacology,
                                    and botany was compiled to frame and support the argument.
                                    Results: <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> proved to be a more likely intoxicant used to induce 
                                    the <span class="berserkers">berserker</span> rage state.
                                    Conclusions: With its anticholinergic tropane <span class="alkaloids">alkaloids</span> and symptom profile, 
                                    <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> is a much more likely cause
                                    of the <span class="berserkers">berserker</span> state than <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>. 
                                    Though there is not enough archaeological and historical evidence to
                                    prove or disprove this theory, it provides a novel explanation that is at present the most viable means of understanding

                                    Intoxicating plants of the botanical family Solanaceae have found
                                    use across both time and space for a variety of purposes. Whether it is
                                    <span class="brugmansia">Brugmansia</span> being occasionally added to 
                                    the famous <span class="ayahuasca">Ayahuasca</span> of
                                    South/Central America (De Rios, 1970) or <span class="daturaStramonium">Datura stramonium L.</span> being
                                    added to cider in France (Prado, 2004), these plants have played important religious, medicinal, and recreational roles for humans from
                                    many cultures. Though this family, which contains many common food
                                    plants such as tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and peppers, is not as
                                    widely employed by humans as grasses and legumes, it still ranks
                                    among the most used groups of plants (Boyd et al., 1984). This is also
                                    one of the few botanical families that contains a disproportionally high
                                    number of <span class="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> plants, with some of its members containing

                                    (Adamse et al., 2014; Alrashedy and Molina, 2016).
                                    These substances are, however, not like most <span class="hallucinogen">hallucinogens</span>, and are
                                    classified as deliriants for their strong <span class="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> effects that cloud
                                    the mind and cause intense and realistic <span class="hallucinogen">hallucinations</span> (Díaz, 2010).
                                    These plants have also been frequently implicated as being associated
                                    with the witches of Europe and their supposed <span class="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> flying
                                    ointments (Carruthers, 2015).

                                    Along with the famed witches, another widely known group from 
                                    Europe existed that is often said to have made use of a <span class="psychoactive">psychoactive</span>

                                    theory was recorded by the famed writer, Ödmann (1784). Ergotism,
                                    alcohol, mental illness, and many other theories have been put forward
                                    since, however <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> seems to be the most widely accepted

                                    distribution during the time of the <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> is taken into account,

                                    Exactly who the <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> were is a matter of controversy in itself.
                                    Originally, the term is thought to have emerged in reference to a specific 
                                    hero in <span class="norse">Norse</span> mythology who fought without armour, thus leaving
                                    him “ber sark” or bare skinned (Fabing, 1956). Then, during the Saga
                                    period (870–1030 CE) in <span class="location Iceland" id="Iceland">Iceland</span> and <span class="location Scandinavia" id="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</span>, a group of warriors
                                    arose known by the same name before their sudden disappearance
                                    around the <span class="12thcenturyCE">12th century CE</span> (Fabing, 1956). Actual direct references,
                                    however, are often unclear; even the meaning of the word <span class="berserkers">berserker</span> has
                                    been thought to perhaps mean “bear skin” rather than “bare skin” and
                                    refer to these warriors wearing bear or animal pelts in their battles
                                    (Liberman, 2004; Wade, 2016). This lack of information exists in large
                                    part due to the fact that knowledge of the <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> was not recorded
                                    substantially until after the tradition had been outlawed by the Christian 
                                    church while seeking to stamp out paganism and because the
                                    writings that did exist were often made by Christian writers with an
                                    agenda to denounce these traditions (Wade, 2016). Some archaeological 
                                    items from the period display images of warriors whose bodies
                                    are covered in animal skins, and various myths among the <span class="norse">Norse</span> 
                                    peoples point to warriors dressing in the skins of bears and wolves to gain
                                    their ferocity, but there is no concrete way to associate these 
                                    phenomena (Wade, 2016). Iconography from the period does also seem to
                                    display that <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> were among the social elite of the time, though
                                    this too is open to interpretation (Dale, 2017). Ultimately, all that can
                                    be said with certainty is that they were elite warriors who were known
                                    for their recklessness in battle and that they may have fought without
                                    armour (Liberman, 2004).

                                    The <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> were said to be not just ordinary warriors, but rather
                                    to fight while in a specific <span class="trance">trance</span>-like state, which was likely helpful in
                                    dissociating them from the close-up atrocities they would have seen and
                                    committed in battle (Wade, 2016). This state has been variously
                                    claimed to involve anger, increased strength, a dulled sense of pain,
                                    decreases in their levels of humanity and reason, behaviour akin to that
                                    of wild animals (including howling and biting on their shields), shivering, 
                                    chattering of their teeth, chill in the body, and invulnerability to
                                    iron (swords) as well as fire (Dale, 2017; Fabing, 1956; Speidel, 2002;
                                    Wade, 2016). Additionally, they were said to attack enemies indiscriminately 
                                    with no sense of friend or foe and to throw off their armour
                                    in battle (Fabing, 1956; Wade, 2016).

                                    When the state wore off after about one day, the <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> were
                                    said to experience several days of weakness and dulled mental capacity
                                    (Fabing, 1956). Reports also seem to point to clubs being needed to
                                    defeat <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> since blades could not harm them; this has been 
                                    interpreted by some as potential proof of the term <span class="berserkers">berserker</span> referring to
                                    warriors who wore animal skins, since pelts would provide some 
                                    protection against the cutting of swords but would do very little to protect
                                    from the blunt trauma involved in attacks with clubs (Dale, 2017).

                                    Though often thought of out of context within popular culture, it
                                    has been suggested that the <span class="norse">Norse</span> <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> were in fact part of a
                                    larger tradition of Indo-European “ecstatic” warriors who made use of
                                    <span class="trance">trance</span>-like states in battle (Speidel, 2002).

                                    <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> is a <span class="mushroom">mushroom</span> of up to 20 cm in height; the
                                    European form has a red cap, often bearing white flecks of old tissue,
                                    and is almost equally as wide as it is tall at maturity once it has 
                                    flattened into an archetypical toadstool shape (Schultes, Hofmann, &
                                    Rätsch, 2001). Eurasian in origin, this species has now been introduced
                                    to various other parts of the world (Geml et al., 2008). It primarily
                                    grows in acidic soils in birch forests and is most prevalent from late
                                    summer to early autumn (Czigany, 1980; Lee et al., 2018). 
                                    Discovered in 1869, muscarine was originally thought to be the
                                    compound responsible for the <span class="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> effects of <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>
                                    (Schultes, 1977). This substance, however, proved to be a minor
                                    constituent of the alkaloid profile of the <span class="mushroom">mushroom</span>, and to merely be a
                                    cause of many unpleasant physiological side effects associated with the
                                    use of <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> (Feeney, 2010). Nearly a century later, the true
                                    <span class="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> components were isolated, proving to be <span class="muscimol">muscimol</span> and
                                    <span class="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>, though to this day it remains unclear if other as of yet
                                    unknown substances also play a role (Feeney, 2010; Halpern, 2004; Lee

                                    The most abundant of the principal compounds, <span class="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>, 
                                    appears in levels as high as 40 g/kg dry weight, though this quantity
                                    varies vastly, with another study, for example, reporting <span class="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>
                                    as only 1 g/kg dry weight of <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> (Feeney, 2010; Lee et al.,
                                    2018; Lumpert and Kreft, 2016). Though high in content, this substance
                                    is 5–10 times weaker in <span class="psychoactive">psychoactivity</span> than its counterpart, <span class="muscimol">muscimol</span>

                                    Likely the primary cause of <span class="psychoactive">psychoactivity</span> in 
                                    <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>, <span class="muscimol">muscimol</span>
                                    is formed through the decarboxylation of <span class="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>; this occurs
                                    through dehydration of the <span class="mushroom">mushroom</span>'s tissues, but may also occur in
                                    the human stomach (Feeney, 2010; Lee et al., 2018). Along with 
                                    <span class="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>, these compounds are both excreted in human urine to 
                                    various degrees (Støíbrný et al., 2012). These two substances also offer an
                                    explanation regarding the vast variability in the <span class="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> effects of
                                    <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>, with seasonal variations in the ratio between <span class="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>
                                    and <span class="muscimol">muscimol</span> likely being the cause (Lee et al., 2018; Schultes, 1977).
                                    This may explain why various groups in the far east of <span class="location Siberia"  id="Siberia">Siberia</span> who were
                                    known for making use of this <span class="mushroom">mushroom</span> preferred spring and summer

                                    Traditional use also aligns with what has come to be known of the
                                    chemistry of <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span>. Known to be used by a variety of tribes
                                    in the extreme northeast and extreme west of <span class="location Siberia" id="Siberia">Siberia</span> for their religious
                                    rituals, these <span class="mushroom">mushrooms</span> were often dried before being eaten, or were
                                    made into infusions over the course of 5–6 days (Brekham, 1967;
                                    Czigany, 1980; Lee et al., 2018; Schultes, 1969; Wasson, 1967). This
                                    drying would, as previously mentioned, serve to convert <span class="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>
                                    into <span class="muscimol">muscimol</span>, thus making the <span class="mushroom">mushrooms</span> more potent. As for the
                                    infusions, <span class="muscimol">muscimol</span> is more soluble than <span class="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>, so a beverage
                                    made from <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> would effectively extract the most <span class="psychoactive">psychoactive</span>
                                    portion of the <span class="mushroom">mushroom</span> (Feeney, 2010). A typical experience among
                                    the <span class="location Siberia" id="Siberia">Siberian</span> tribes involved a drunken state associated with auditory
                                    <span class="hallucinogen">hallucinations</span> and changes in the colour of the consumer's vision; it was

                                    snow into which they urinated, thus themselves getting high (Lee et al.,
                                    2018).

                                    <span class="muscimol">Muscimol</span> acts as a strong GABA-A agonist, especially in the central
                                    nervous system (Satora et al., 2005), though its <span class="hallucinogen">hallucinogenic</span> action
                                    has been reported to arise primarily from its binding at GABA-B sites
                                    (Mikaszewska-Sokolewicz et al., 2016). In contrast, <span class="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span> acts
                                    most strongly at N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors by

                                    explains why it is unable to be the substance responsible for the

                                    Waser, 1967). The multiple effects of these substances significantly
                                    limits their potential usefulness in clinical settings (Krogsgaard-Larsen

                                    First isolated in the 1800s, <span class="scopolamine">scopolamine</span> has been found in all parts
                                    of the plant (Passos and Mironidou-Tzouveleki, 2016). This explains its
                                    extensive historical use in Europe since ancient Greece as a narcotic,
                                    anaesthetic, pain killer, cure for insomnia, in the treatment for 
                                    respiratory ailments, in the famous soporific sponge, and many more
                                    (Carter, 1996; Daunay et al., 2007; Gorun et al., 2011; Hocking, 1947;

                                    has also found use in Tibetan medicine, traditional Chinese medicine,
                                    and Ayurveda for similar purposes (Goyal et al., 2009; Patočka and

                                    In addition to its medicinal uses, <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> is often claimed
                                    to have been a plant used by the witches of Europe (Schultes et al.,
                                    2001). It has been suggested that it was used in love potions, witches'
                                    brews, and in the famous <span class="hallucinogen">hallucinogenic</span> flying ointments (Aulakh and
                                    Mukerjee, 1984; Disel et al., 2015; Lee and Schilling, 2006). It is also
                                    thought by some to have been burned at the ancient oracle in Delphi
                                    thus allowing the seers to enter <span class="trance">trances</span> and receive their prophecies
                                    (Paulsen, 2010). Such magical uses are, however, largely conjecture;
                                    flying ointments, for example, are said by some to not have even existed
                                    (Ostling, 2016). It was also used extensively in Europe as a means of
                                    fortifying beer, and for making other forms of <span class="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> beverages
                                    (Kromar, 1979; Lee and Schilling, 2006). So often was it used that a law
                                    was passed in 1507 in what is now Germany to prohibit its use in the
                                    making of ales (Daunay et al., 2007). Repeated use was also known to
                                    cause insanity, but this did not impact its popularity as it likely 
                                    presented a form of intoxicant available even to the poorest people who
                                    could not afford more costly pleasures (Müller, 1998; Schultes, 1969).
                                    Indeed, repeated doses above 3 mg per day have been shown to cause
                                    lasting behavioural and mental changes (Maior et al., 2017). 
                                    Additionally, the symptoms of <span class="norse">Norse</span> <span class="berserkers">berserker</span> warriors align somewhat
                                    with those ascribed to werewolves: wearing of animal pelts, raging, and
                                    irregular behaviour, which in turn line up with symptoms caused by the
                                    anticholinergic  <span class="alkaloids">tropane alkaloids</span>, believed by some to be the cause of
                                    the werewolf phenomenon (Copeland, 2018; Piomelli and Pollio,

                                    and <span class="scopolamine">scopolamine</span> antagonise 
                                    muscarine receptors in the central and peripheral nervous
                                    systems in the place of acetylcholine, thus earning them the title of
                                    anticholinergic substances (Sayin, 2016). Though five subtypes of
                                    muscarinic receptors exist in the human body, these substances do not
                                    selectively bond to any one type and thus cause a wide range of
                                    symptoms (Gadzikowska and Grynkiewicz, 2002). Their effects are
                                    especially pronounced in the smooth muscles and secretory glands of
                                    the body as well as in the brain (Moulton and Fryer, 2011; Simone and
                                    Margarucci, 2008). These substances produce virtually identical
                                    symptoms, though as previously mentioned <span class="scopolamine">scopolamine</span> presents a
                                    central nervous system effect that is eight times stronger than that seen

                                    blurred vision), decreased bronchial secretion, decreased sweating (and
                                    thus drying of skin), bradycardia or tachycardia (depending on dosage),
                                    ataxia, hyperthermia, flushing of the skin, headache, hyperreflexia,
                                    incoordination, somnolence, restlessness, decreased ability to pay attention,

                                    and thus <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> can be used (and indeed still is in many places)

                                    Though originally a Mediterranean species, <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> was
                                    likely introduced to <span class="location Scandinavia" id="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</span> as far back as the Roman Iron Age
                                    (Heimdahl, 2009). Since it was not native to the region, it has been
                                    suggested that this provides proof of the plant being brought further
                                    north and cultivated for its medicinal properties (Karg, 2010). Though
                                    this may be true, it cannot be dismissed as a theory that <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> may
                                    have migrated with humans accidentally and begun to spread as a
                                    weed. It is also worth noting that carbonised remains resulting from
                                    burning are the most likely plant tissues to survive in the archaeological
                                    record; paleobotanical finds may thus disproportionally represent
                                    plants that have been used in manners related to fire (Day, 2013).
                                    Whatever the reason for its migration, this plant was an established
                                    weed at centres of trade by the Viking age, making it a viable candidate
                                    for use by warriors of the time (Heimdahl, 2009).

                                    <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> seeds have been found in association with Viking
                                    age sites in Denmark (Rohde Sloth, Lund Hansen and Karg, 2013) and
                                    Finland (Vuorela et al., 1996), with signs of obvious cultivation of the
                                    plant tending to emerge around the middle ages (Alanko and Uotila,
                                    2017; Åsen, 2009; Heimdahl, 2009). Though the Viking age findings are
                                    inconclusive in many cases, it seems that the plant was being used at
                                    this time. Carbonised seeds as well as seeds associated with graves both
                                    suggest potential use in these sites. Additionally, a grave from 
                                    approximately 980 CE in Denmark included a pouch of <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> seeds with
                                    a woman whose clothing, jewellery, and other grave goods suggested
                                    she was a priestess/shaman of high social class who may have used the
                                    seeds to produce visions (Pentz et al., 2009). Though this cannot be
                                    proven without further archaeological findings, the fact that the seeds
                                    were in a pouch and buried with her suggests their importance and
                                    unequivocally points to some form of use in <span class="location Scandinavia" id="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</span> during the
                                    Viking age. This in itself provides a much more concrete argument for
                                    the use of <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> to produce 
                                    the <span class="berserkers">berserker</span> <span class="trance">trance</span> than any that may be

                                    Though <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> is invasive in many regions where it has
                                    been introduced, analysis of trade routes in <span class="location Siberia" id="Siberia">Siberia</span> has shown that it
                                    was not ubiquitous at the times when it was more widely used for ritual
                                    purposes there (Geml et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2018). Some authors have
                                    even suggested that the reason behind the drinking of urine of those
                                    who had consumed the <span class="mushroom">mushroom</span> was due to its shortage (Buck, 1963).
                                    Though this may be true, it could just as likely be an etic assumption on
                                    the part of European observers who were unaware of the ways in which
                                    the human body improves the substance by filtering out the 
                                    non-<span class="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> components responsible for many unpleasant physical effects.
                                    Regardless, <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> would have likely been much harder to come by
                                    than <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span>, with the former needing to grow in forests where its

                                    writing from the 1700s on the topic also includes a potential 
                                    explanation: in order to guard their prestige and position in society, <span class="norse">Norse</span>
                                    <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> may have kept their use of intoxicants a secret (Fabing,
                                    1956). This would also prevent enemies from gaining access to their
                                    increased abilities. Though Ödmann writes of this in reference to
                                    <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span>, the theory applies equally well to <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span>.
                                    This also aligns with the general lack of knowledge of <span class="psychoactive">psychoactive</span>
                                    substance use in Europe; when the Christian church labelled such plants
                                    as heretical and suppressed their use and information about them, they
                                    effectively destroyed much of the tradition and knowledge that could
                                    be used in the present day to piece together the history of European

                                    Perhaps the largest problem involved in untangling this historical
                                    mystery is the large degree of similarity seen between intoxications of

                                    consumed by humans that scientists spent many years searching for
                                    <span class="alkaloids">tropane alkaloids</span> in <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> (Buck, 1963; Waser, 1967). Despite the
                                    similarity of their symptoms, the substances have opposite chemical
                                    effects; <span class="atropine">atropine</span>, for example, is an antidote for muscarine poisoning
                                    (Kirchmair et al., 2012). Though there are many similarities in effects,
                                    it is worth noting that the increased salivation and sweating seen in <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>
                                    ingestion as well as the nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea are
                                    symptoms typical for this <span class="mushroom">mushroom</span> but not for plants containing

                                    cause a marked decrease in salivation and perspiration, which stands in
                                    stark contrast to the effects of muscarine (Waser, 1967). Unfortunately,
                                    such symptoms are difficult to distinguish from historical records.

                                    1976; Shams et al., 2017). This effect is also likely long known in
                                    Croatia, where the verb “buniti” meaning to fight or protest was derived
                                    from the local name for <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> (bunika), and a saying translating to “as
                                    if they had eaten <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span>” is used to refer to an angered 
                                    individual (Pronk, 2012). This anger effect can range from agitation to
                                    full-blown rage and combativeness depending on the dosage and the
                                    individual's mental set. As this is perhaps the most defining component
                                    of the <span class="berserkers">berserker</span> state, this symptom is of central importance in 
                                    identifying potential causes and provides a very critical reason as to 
                                    why <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> is a more appropriate theoretical intoxicant for the <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> than
                                    <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>.
                                </p>

                                    Another commonly reported symptom in cases of intoxications with
                                    <span class="alkaloids">tropane alkaloids</span> from solanaceous plants involves an inability on the
                                    part of the intoxicated individual to recognise the faces of people they
                                    know (Adegoke and Alo, 2013; Berdai et al., 2012; Korkmaz et al.,
                                    2018; Villain et al., 2008). As it has been claimed that the <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span>
                                    did not distinguish between friends and foes in battle, it seems that such
                                    a mechanism could have been at play. Though this could also be due to
                                    <span class="hallucinogen">hallucinations</span> that could be caused by either intoxicant, it seems more
                                    likely that this element of confusion pertaining to identification is here
                                    implicated. The <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span>' fearlessness is also likely a result of this
                                    altered mental state produced by <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> and its <span class="alkaloids">alkaloids</span>.

                                    Yet another compelling possibility is their removal of clothing;
                                    though authors tend to claim that <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> would throw off their
                                    armour (and possibly their shirts, depending on which interpretation of
                                    the word <span class="berserkers">berserker</span> we employ) in battle to display their bravery, it is
                                    possible that this was a result of intoxication by <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span>. In
                                    many cases of intoxication by related solanaceous plants, individuals
                                    have been known to remove their clothing and be found walking
                                    around naked (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1995;
                                    Gangl-Žvikart, 2002; Kromar, 1979; Mikolich et al., 1975; Weil, 1977).
                                    This trend has also been displayed in my own ongoing research with
                                    individuals employing anticholinergic solanaceous plants for 
                                    recreational and spiritual purposes. Whether this is due to the hyperthermia
                                    caused by these <span class="alkaloids">tropane alkaloids</span> or for another reason such as 
                                    increased sensitivity and annoyance by fabric on the skin is unknown.
                                </p>
                              
                                <p>
                                    Finally, the ingestion of <span class="alkaloids">anticholinergic tropane alkaloids</span> is 
                                    sometimes associated with a drop in blood pressure (Brown and Laiken,
                                    2011). Though this may also occur in <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> poisonings, increased
                                    blood pressure has also been recorded making the exact effects 
                                    questionable (Kirchmair et al., 2012; Waser, 1967). With significant
                                    lowering of blood pressure, the individual would bleed less readily, and
                                    this may perhaps be the basis for the notion that swords were unable to
                                    harm the <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> (Arima et al., 2012; Castaneda et al., 2000; Durmus
                                    et al., 2007; Hasegawa et al., 2003; Stern et al., 1993). Though 
                                    obviously inflated with time, perhaps their surprisingly small amount of
                                    blood loss would have led to their enemies referring to them as immune
                                    to the blade, with the details later being lost through time. Indeed, the
                                    antihaemorrhagic properties of <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> were well enough known 
                                    towards the end of the time of the <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span> for them to be included in
                                    Avicenna's Canon of Medicine (Aziz et al., 2000). Though this arose far
                                    from the geographic range of the <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span>, it is entirely possible that
                                    they too were aware of this property of the plant and thus 
                                    consumed <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> for this reason. Similarly, their supposed immunity to fire may
                                    have simply referred to the pain dampening effects of the 
                                    anticholinergic <span class="alkaloids">alkaloids</span> 
                                    of <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span>. It is worth noting here that the closely
                                    related Mandragora with its similar alkaloid composition has been 
                                    implicated as the plant of Greek myth that the sorceress Medea used to
                                    make Jason immune to fire in his quest for the golden fleece (Harris,
                                    1916). These, however, are by far the most speculative of the symptoms
                                    here discussed, and are not strong indicators of the viability of this
                                    theory. Such a drop in blood pressure, for example, would also likely
                                    cause weakness that would be undesirable in battle.

                                    Some symptoms of the <span class="berserkers">berserkers</span>, however, cannot be well 
                                    explained in the context of <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> or <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> 
                                    poisoning. The chattering of teeth they were said to experience may 
                                    perhaps have been a result of muscle spasms arising from the use of either
                                    substance, though when taken into account that they were also said to
                                    experience chills in the body, perhaps they were simply cold and 
                                    shivering, which would be unsurprising if they were to walk around
                                    without much clothing on in cold northern climates. This, however,
                                    goes in direct contrast to the hyperthermia that both of these 
                                    intoxicants cause. Likewise, their shield biting may have simply been an
                                    attempt to stop chattering teeth when cold. It is possible that the odd
                                    array of symptoms may represent the use of <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> in conjunction with
                                    another substance (perhaps even <span class="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>) rather than simply
                                    <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> alone, however there is not enough historical, 
                                    archaeological, or modern pharmaceutical evidence to substantiate this.
                                    Either way, this constellation of symptoms is difficult to explain in any
                                    manner and all theories for this are guesses at best.

                                    The present article has been able to provide a theory: that
                                    <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> was used by the famed <span class="berserkers">berserker</span> warriors of the Saga

                                    Ultimately, future finds will determine if this theory will be proven or
                                    disproven. The most reliable form of archaeological/historical data
                                    combines paleobotanical and textual/artifactual information in order to
                                    provide a complete picture of the past (Merlin, 2003). The present 
                                    investigation has done just this, showing that at present the data available
                                    supports the potential use of <span class="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> as an intoxicating agent to induce

                                    cause accepted by many, we have seen here that the symptomology of
                                    the <span class="berserkers">berserker</span> state aligns much better with an intoxication arising from

                                    viable option as a result of its presence in <span class="location Scandinavia" id="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</span> during this time
                                    period and its association with various archaeological sites that show it

                                    commonly was growing as a weed in areas of human habitation.

                                    in Europe, however, this theory came to me as a result of the

                                    confirm or deny the speculative ethnobotanical perspective here presented.
