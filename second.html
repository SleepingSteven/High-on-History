                                                Every night a picket guard went to an outpost 1½ miles

                                                The soldiers departed for their shift perfectly sober, 
                                                yet when they returned to the post the next morning they
                                                caused trouble “on account of being drunk.” Investigations 
                                                failed to reveal the source of their <span class="whiskey">whiskey</span>. 
                                                Searches of canteens and gear turned up nothing suspicious. 
                                                But there was one odd thing about the detachment: someone in <span class="BenjaminButler">Butler</span>’s
                                                command noticed that the men always held their muskets straight up in a 
                                                peculiar manner. The mystery unraveled when their muskets were examined. 
                                                “Every gun barrel,” wrote Butler, “was found to be filled with <span class="whiskey">whiskey</span>.”

                                                had caused so much trouble and crime among Confederate soldiers and civilian

                                                Apothecaries were allowed to dispense

Another man jumped into a ship’s boat, cut the painter, and escaped. The Confederates followed Kineo for a time before changing course and making a dash for shore. Seeing  Sting Ray change course, <span class="JohnWatters">Lt. Cmdr.

To cajole soldiers into taking <span class="quinine">quinine</span>, some surgeons mixed it with <span class="whiskey">whiskey</span>. This created the opposite problem; some soldiers enjoyed the <span class="quinine">quinine</span>-<span class="whiskey">whiskey</span> dose so much that they sneaked through the line for a second prescription. While stationed at <span class="location NewBern_NorthCarolina" id="NewBern_NorthCarolina">New Bern, North Carolina</span>, the men of the <span class="a44thMassachusetts">44th Massachusetts</span> found that their medical officers took precautions to limit the soldiers to one dose each.

                                                Drunkenness could be overlooked if it occurred when a soldier was off duty and did not compound his offense with other crimes. Court-martial of officers charged with drunkenness was handled differently from those of enlisted men. Officers found guilty could be cashiered with forfeiture of pay. In addition to dismissal, a Confederate law of <span class="y1862">1862</span> allowed a public reprimand of officers convicted of drunkenness. An officer dismissed from the Confederate service could also be
                                                conscripted back into the ranks as an enlisted man. Enlisted personnel found guilty of drunkenness usually faced some form of confinement, corporal punishment, or public shaming. Penalties varied depending on the degree of the soldier’s offense and the policies of his commanding officer. Common punishments for drunken enlisted men included confinement in a guard tent or guardhouse, wearing a barrel with a placard noting that the culprit was a drunk, extra duty, or a spell carrying a log or marching with a knapsack filled with rocks.

Another way of coping with the lack of <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> was to make a joke of it. By early <span class="y1864">1864</span>, “starvation parties” were becoming a fad in <span class="location Richmond" id="Richmond">Richmond</span>. Attendees wore the best finery they could manage.

The many creative ways <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> found its way to soldiers and sailors, and the methods used to control its influence, are intertwined with the story of battles, generals, regiments, and ships of war.

                                    <p>The plethora of comment and reflection on the <span  class="FirstWorldWar">First World
                                        War</span> has overlooked the importance of that war for <span class="drug">drug</span> and
                                        <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> control. Yet this war was crucial in the establishment
                                        of a system of international control for <span class="drug">drugs</span> that still
                                        endures today. It instituted models of control for <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> that
                                        also had a lengthy life. In 2014, the First World War is still a
                                        potent presence so far as drugs and <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> are concerned.
                                        International <span class="drug">drug</span> control had been discussed before the
                                        war, but a global system was unlikely. The major initiative
                                        had come from the Americans in the <span  class="early1900s">early 1900s</span>, driven by
                                        twin motives of moral regulation and strategic advantage
                                        in the <span class="location FarEast" id="FarEast">Far East</span>. The Americans believed that “civilising” and
                                        converting the <span class="Chinese">Chinese</span> would come through the ending of
                                        their <span class="opium"    >opium</span> consumption. Missionaries and the <span class="USStateDepartment">US State Department</span> 
                                        had trained their sights on the Indo-Chinese opium 
                                        trade, a trade which civil servants in the <span class="BritishForeignOffice">British Foreign Office</span> 
                                        were already bringing to a close. 
                                        <a class="lod" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Opium_Commission">The Shanghai Convention of <span class="y1909">1909</span></a> 
                                        retained a Far Eastern focus, but
                                        afterwards the compass of potential control widened. There
                                        was genuine concern in the <span class="BritishForeignOffice">British Foreign Office</span> about
                                        <span class="morphine">morphine</span> and <span class="cocaine">cocaine</span> smuggling in southeast <span class="Asia">Asia</span> 
                                        and this topic was taken up by the Americans as an important part of
                                        the international control agenda. The Hague Convention 
                                        of <span class="y1912">1912</span> was the product of this expanded geographical concern. 
                                        The decision at the Hague that <span class="opium">opium</span>, 
                                        <span class="morphine">morphine</span>, and <span class="cocaine">cocaine</span> and their use should be confined 
                                        to “legitimate medical purposes” was central to future international <span class="drug">drug</span> control. 
                                        Earlier enquiries, such
                                        as the <a class="lod" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission_on_Opium"><span class="IndianRoyalCommissionOpium">Indian Royal Commission on Opium</span></a> of <span class="y1895">1895</span>, 
                                        had defended medical and non-medical use, and indeed had taken the view that it was difficult to 
                                        distinguish one type of use from the other. But there were further complications about extending control. 
                                        The <span class="GermanGovernment">German Government</span> refused to adhere to the Convention 
                                        because it might be only partially applied and therefore damage the German <span class="cocaine">cocaine</span> industry; 
                                        it insisted that all 34 participating powers had to ratify <a class="lod" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907">the Hague Convention</a> before
                                        it could come into force.
                                        The convention thus had an “all or nothing” aspect that had not been initially intended. As the 
                                        <span class="BritishDelegates">British Delegates</span> wrote in their Report, “It [the convention] has, 
                                        for the first time, laid down as a principle of international morality that the various countries concerned cannot 
                                        stand alone in these measures.” The German proviso was a delaying tactic and so only those countries 
                                        committed to further controls went ahead before the outbreak of war. The <span class="location USA" id="USA">USA</span> 
                                        was one, keen to take a prohibitionist stance. The US Harrison Act
                                        of <span class="y1914">1914</span>, a revenue measure, aimed to restrict access to <span class="drug">drugs</span> and to
                                        “stamp out” addiction. Other countries were less keen and by the outbreak of the <span  class="FirstWorldWar">First World War</span>,
                                        there had been only eight ratifications. In the <span class="location UK" id="UK">UK</span>, rather 
                                        desultory discussions before the war envisaged simply an extension of existing pharmacy controls and possibly 
                                        some further restrictions on the dispensing of doctors’ prescriptions. The <span  class="FirstWorldWar">war</span> 
                                        changed the situation. In the <span class="location UK" id="UK">UK</span>, it brought the 
                                        Home Office in 2014 still the lead department 
                                        for drug policy—into a central role and also more stringent restriction onto the agenda. Two issues caused concern. 
                                        Smuggling of <span class="drug">drugs</span> showed that controls were indeed interdependent at the international level. 
                                        The <span class="location UK" id="UK">UK</span> was the world’s major manufacturer of <span class="morphine">morphine</span> 
                                        and the exported <span class="drug">drug</span> was being diverted into <span class="location China" id="China">China</span> 
                                        via <span class="location China" id="China">Japan</span>. The Home Office introduced a 
                                        system of import/export certification designed to ensure that all shipments out of the country had a legitimate 
                                        destination. <span class="morphine">Morphine</span> was the main smuggled <span class="drug">drug</span> but the use 
                                        of <span class="cocaine">cocaine</span> also seemed to be expanding in some of the combatant countries. 
                                        It was feared that army effi ciency was at risk. In the <span class="location UK" id="UK">UK</span>, the 
                                        “drug scare” first arose in <span class="location Folkestone" id="Folkestone">Folkestone</span> 
                                        with sales to Canadian soldiers billeted there. Then the <span class="location WestEnd" id="WestEnd">West End</span>
                                        of <span class="location London" id="London">London</span> became the focus; 
                                        there were fears that sex workers and others were selling <span class="drug">drugs</span> to soldiers. 
                                        Pharmacy laws were powerless to stop the trade despite some attempts at prosecution. 
                                        The Daily Chronicle
                                        expressed the fears of the time. ‘It <span class="cocaine">[cocaine]</span> is driving hundreds of 
                                        women mad. What is worse, it will drive, unless the traffic in it is checked,

                                        regulation 40B, which tightened domestic controls. It made non-medical possession an offence and required a doctor’s prescription 
                                        for <span class="cocaine">cocaine</span>. <span class="location Germany" id="Germany">Germany</span>, <span class="location Canada" id="Canada">Canada</span>, and other

                                        A full control machinery covered manufacture, trade in, and distribution of addictive substances, 
                                        with an import/export certificate system based on the British model. <span class="cannabis">Cannabis</span> was brought 
                                        into the system in the <span class="y1920s">1920s</span>. <span class="alcohol">Alcohol</span> control, like <span class="opium"    >opium</span>, 
                                        was also a matter of international concern before the <span  class="FirstWorldWar">war</span>. 
                                        But the <span  class="FirstWorldWar">war</span> did not lead to a similar international convention, 
                                        only a regional system which covered colonies in <span class="location Africa" id="Africa">Africa</span>. 
                                        <span  class="FirstWorldWar">War</span> nevertheless had a longstanding impact at the national level. 
                                        British and American forms of control were different. In the <span class="location UK" id="UK">UK</span>, 
                                        concerns about the impact of <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> on the <span  class="FirstWorldWar">war</span> 
                                        effort brought central state regulation. The drink issue was adroitly used by <span class="LloydGeorge">Lloyd George</span> as 
                                        Minister of Munitions and at one stage he considered wholesale state purchase of the 
                                        drink trade. Drink nationalisation was not practical politics and instead a Central Control Board (CCB) 
                                        was set up in <span class="y1915">1915</span>. It was given wide powers to regulate and even to purchase the trade in key 
                                        military and naval areas and its overall powers extended to the whole country by <span class="y1916">1916</span>. 
                                        The CCB limited the hours of consumption and introduced the famous “afternoon gap”, 
                                        when pubs and clubs had to close. “Off” sales of spirits were prohibited in the evenings and at weekends and their 
                                        strength was reduced. Servicemen had been plied with drinks in pubs so “treating” (buying rounds) was forbidden. 
                                        The CCB, chaired by <span class="ViscountAbernon">Viscount D’Abernon</span>, 
                                        had a research committee and was concerned to base its actions on scientific evidence. 
                                        State control of the trade was introduced in certain key military areas <span class="location EnfieldLock"id="EnfieldLock">Enfield Lock</span> near 
                                        <span class="location London" id="London">London</span>, and the <span class="location Carlisle" id="Carlisle">Carlisle</span> area. 
                                        Industrial canteens were established. The CCB even set up its own pubs and the war thus 
                                        brought the introduction of a system which had been widely discussed 
                                        before war— ”disinterested management”—pubs</span> run not for a profit, 
                                        under state control. Statistics showed that such policies, which were widely accepted by the public, 
                                        had an impact on measures of harm from <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span>, such as deaths from 
                                        cirrhosis of the liver and arrests for drunkenness. 
                                        By the early <span class="y1920s">1920s</span> per capita        
                                        spirit consumption in the <span class="location UK" id="UK">UK</span> had halved from its 
                                        prewar level and beer consumption also declined. Convictions        
                                        for drunkenness fell from more than 130 000 to just over 29 000 per year. 
                                        Unlike <span class="drug">drug control</span>, this overall system of 
                                        <span class="alcohol">alcohol control</span> did not persist into the postwar years. 
                                        Central control was abandoned, although some elements of the war time system remained in existence. 
                                        In the <span class="location USA" id="USA">USA</span>, by contrast, war time restrictions 
                                        led to national prohibition enacted in <span class="y1920s">1920</span>. 
                                        That system lasted only until <span class="y1920s">1929</span>, but like war time controls in 
                                        the <span class="location UK" id="UK">UK</span> it affected patterns of drinking with a move towards 
                                        spirit drinking and a decline in <span class="beer">beer</span> consumption. 
                                        It came to an end not because prohibition “failed” but because industrial and 
                                        business interests, which had once supported it, removed their support as the <a class="lod" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"><span class="GreatDepression">Great Depression</span></a>
                                        took hold. Prohibition in the 
                                        <span class="location USA" id="USA">USA</span> was the best known of efforts 
                                        by a number of countries to introduce similar systems. 
                                        <span class="location Iceland" id="Iceland">Iceland</span> and <span class="location Finland" id="Finland">Finland</span> had already brought in prohibition; 
                                        <span class="location Canada" id="Canada">Canada</span> and <span class="location Norway" id="Norway">Norway</span> had partial prohibition. 
                                        <span class="location Russia" id="Russia">Russia</span> established prohibition during the war while 
                                        <span class="location Sweden" id="Sweden">Sweden</span> voted in favour but never actually put it into practice. 
                                        Further attempts to take controls through the <span class="LeagueNations">League of Nations</span> fell foul of the French, 
                                        representing the interests of the French wine industry. 
                                        There was what <span class="MarkSchrad">Mark Schrad</span> has called a 
                                        “global prohibition wave” drawing on 
                                        prewar temperance interests and catalysed by the war effort. But these attempts ultimately failed. 
                                        For <span class="drug">drugs</span>, a system with its origin in the needs of the colonial powers was 
                                        later to be dominated by the <span class="location USA" id="USA">USA</span>. The system in the 
                                        <span class="FirstWorldWar">First World War</span> morphed into the <a class="lod" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"><span class="UnitedNations">United Nations</span></a> 
                                        control machinery after the <span class="SecondWorldWar">Second World War</span>, where it still remains today. 
                                        Now former colonial countries in <span class="SouthAmerica" id="SouthAmerica">South America</span> are testing the boundaries of the system 
                                        in order to accommodate the culturally sanctioned use of <span class="drug">drugs</span> such as <span class="cocaine">coca</span>. 
                                        But it would be premature to hail the demise of the <span  class="FirstWorldWar">Great War</span> system. 
                                        The <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> restrictions also cast a lengthy shadow—state control lasted in 
                                        <span class="location Carlisle" id="Carlisle">Carlisle</span> until the early <span class="y1970s">1970s</span> 
                                        and the afternoon gap until <span class="y1987">1987</span>. 
                                        Now the <span class="UKGovernment">UK Government</span>’s 
                                        Public Health Responsibility Deal is taking 
                                        on some of the same issues, for example, reduction of the strength of <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span>. 
                                        That deal has controversially brought industry and some public health interests 
                                        together in a way also prefigured by the CCB, which had industry and temperance members, 
                                        although their alliance did not outlive the war. The war time restrictions on <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> still 
                                        stand as an example of what government regulation can achieve in improving health and reducing crime. For both 
                                        <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> and <span class="drug">drugs</span>, the <span  class="FirstWorldWar">First World War</span> 
                                        was an external shock, initiating systems and developments that might never otherwise have come about.

                                    <p>In The Art of War, <span class="SunTzu">Sun Tzu</span> wrote that speed is “the essence of war.” 
                                        While he of course did not have <a class="lod" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"><span class="amphetamine">amphetamines</span></a> in mind, he would no doubt have been impressed by their 
                                        powerful war-facilitating psychoactive effects. <span class="amphetamine">Amphetamines</span>—often called “pep pills,” “go pills,” “uppers” 
                                        or <a class="lod" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"><span class="speed">“speed”</span></a>—are a group of synthetic drugs that stimulate the central nervous system, reducing fatigue and appetite 
                                        and increasing wakefulness and a sense of well-being. The quintessential drug of the modern industrial age, 
                                        <span class="amphetamine">amphetamines</span> arrived relatively late in the history of mind-altering substances—commercialized just in time 
                                        for mass consumption during World War II by the leading industrial powers. That war was not only the most 
                                        destructive war in human history but also the most pharmacologically enhanced. It was literally sped up by <span class="speed">speed</span>.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Few drugs have received a bigger stimulus from war. 
                                        As <span class="LesterGrinspoon">Lester Grinspoon</span> and <span class="PeterHedblom">Peter Hedblom</span> wrote in their classic 1975 study The <span class="speed">Speed</span> Culture, 
                                        “World War II probably gave the greatest impetus to date to legal medically authorized as well as 
                                        illicit black market abuse of these pills on a worldwide scale.”
                                        Japanese, American and British forces consumed large amounts of <span class="amphetamine">amphetamines</span>, 
                                        but the Germans were the most enthusiastic early adopters, pioneering pill-popping on the battlefield 
                                        during the initial phases of the war.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><span class="Nazi">Nazi</span> ideology was fundamentalist in its antidrug stance. 
                                        Social use of drugs was considered both a sign of personal weakness 
                                        and a symbol of the country’s moral decay in the wake of a traumatic and humiliating defeat in World War I.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>But as <span class="NormanOhler">Norman Ohler</span> shows in Blitzed: Drugs in <span class="Nazi">Nazi</span> <span class="location Germany" id="Germany">Germany</span>, 
                                        <span class="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> was the privileged exception. While other drugs were banned or discouraged, 
                                        <span class="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> was touted as a miracle product when it appeared on the market 
                                        in the late <span class="decade1930">1930s</span>. 
                                        Indeed, the little pill was the perfect <span class="Nazi">Nazi</span> drug: “<span class="location Germany" id="Germany">Germany</span>, awake!” 
                                        the <span class="Nazi">Nazis</span> had commanded. 
                                        Energizing and confidence boosting, <span class="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> 
                                        played into the Third Reich’s obsession with physical and mental superiority. 
                                        In sharp contrast to drugs such as <span class="heroin">heroin</span> or <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span>, 
                                        <span class="methamphetamine">methamphetamines</span> were not about escapist pleasure. 
                                        Rather, they were taken for hyper-alertness and vigilance. Aryans, who were the embodiment of 
                                        human perfection in <span class="Nazi">Nazi</span> ideology, could now even aspire to be superhuman—and such 
                                        superhumans could be turned into supersoldiers. 
                                        “We don’t need weak people,” Hitler declared, “we want only the strong!” Weak people took 
                                        drugs such as <span class="opium"    >opium</span> to escape; 
                                        strong people took <span class="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> to feel even stronger.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The German chemist <span class="FriedrichHauschild">Friedrich Hauschild</span> had been aware of the American <span class="amphetamine">amphetamine</span> Benzedrine 
                                        ever since the drug has been used as a doping product in the Olympic Games in Berlin in <span class="decade1930">1936</span>. 
                                        The following year he managed to synthesize <span class="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span>, a close cousin of 
                                        <span class="amphetamine">amphetamine</span>, while working 
                                        for Temmler-Werke, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company. Temmler-Werke began selling <span class="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> under 
                                        the brand name <a class="lod" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine#History,_society,_and_culture"><span class="Pervitin">Pervitin</span></a> in the winter of <span class="decade1930">1937</span>. 
                                        Partly thanks to the company’s aggressive advertising campaign, 
                                        <span class="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> became well known within a few months. The tablets were wildly popular 
                                        and could be purchased without a
                                        prescription in pharmacies. One could even buy boxed chocolates spiked with <span class="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span>. 
                                        But the drug’s
                                        most important use was yet to come.</p>
                                        
                                    <p>Dr. <a class="lod" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Friedrich_Ranke"><span class="OttoRanke">Otto F. Ranke</span></a>, director of the Research Institute of Defense Physiology, 
                                        had high hopes that <span class="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> would prove advantageous on the battlefield. 
                                        His goal was to defeat the enemy with chemically enhanced soldiers, soldiers who could give <span class="location Germany" id="Germany">Germany</span> a military edge 
                                        by fighting harder and longer than 
                                        their opponents. After testing the drug on a group of medical officers, Ranke believed the <span class="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> would be 
                                        “an excellent substance for rousing a weary squad… We may grasp what far-reaching military significance it would 
                                        have if we managed to remove the natural tiredness using medical methods.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p><span class="OttoRanke">Ranke</span> himself was a daily user, as detailed in his wartime medical diary and letters: 
                                        “With <span class="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> you can go on working for 36 to 50 hours without feeling any noticeable fatigue.” 
                                        This allowed <span class="OttoRanke">Ranke</span> to work days at a time with no sleep. And his correspondence indicated that a 
                                        growing number of officers were doing the same thing—popping pills to manage the demands of their jobs.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Wehrmacht medical officers administered <span class="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> to soldiers of the Third Tank Division 
                                        during the occupation of <span class="location Czecholslovakia" id="Czecholslovakia">Czecholslovakia</span> in <span class="decade1930">1938</span>. 
                                        But the invasion of <span class="location Poland" id="Poland">Poland</span> in <span class="decade1930">September 1939</span> served as the first real military test of the drug in the field. 
                                        <span class="location Germany" id="Germany">Germany</span> overran its eastern neighbor by October, with 100,000 Polish soldiers killed in the attack. 
                                        The invasion introduced a new form of industrialized warfare, <a class="lod" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a>. This “lightning war” 
                                        emphasized speed and surprise, catching the enemy off guard by the unprecedented quickness of 
                                        the mechanized attack and advance. The weak link in the Blitzkrieg strategy was the soldiers, 
                                        who were humans rather than machines and as such suffered from fatigue. 
                                        They required regular rest and sleep, which, of course, slowed down the military advance.
                                        That is where <span class="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> came in—part of the speed of the Blitzkrieg literally came from <span class="speed">speed</span>. 
                                        As medical historian <span class="PeterSteinkamp">Peter Steinkamp</span> puts it, “Blitzkrieg was guided by <span class="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span>. 
                                        If not to say that Blitzkrieg was founded on <span class="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span>.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>In <span class="decade1930">late 1939</span> and early <span class="y1940">1940</span>, <span class="LeoConti">Leo Conti</span>, the “Reich Health Führer,” and others sounded the alarm bells 
                                        about the risk of <span class="Pervitin">Pervitin</span>, resulting in the drug being made available by prescription only. 
                                        But these warnings largely fell on deaf ears, and the new regulations were widely ignored. 
                                        Use of the drug continued to grow. At the Temmler-Werke factory, production revved into overdrive, 
                                        pressing as many as 833,000 tablets per day. Between April and July <span class="y1940">1940</span>, German servicemen received 
                                        more than 35 million <span class="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> tablets. The drug was even dispensed to pilots and tank 
                                        crews in the form of chocolate bars known as Fliegerschokolade (flyer’s chocolate) and Panzerschokolade (tanker’s chocolate).</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Armies had long consumed various psychoactive substances, but this was the first large-scale 
                                        use of a synthetic performance-enhancing drug. Historian <span class="ShelbyStanton">Shelby Stanton</span> comments: 
                                        “They dispensed it to the line troops. Ninety percent of their army had to march on foot, 
                                        day and night. It was more important for them to keep punching during the Blitzkrieg than to get a good night’s sleep. 
                                        The whole damn army was hopped up. It was one of the secrets of Blitzkrieg.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The Blitzkreig depended on <span class="speed">speed</span>, relentlessly pushing ahead with tank troops, day and night. 
                                        In April <span class="y1940">1940</span>, it quickly led to the fall of <span class="location Denmark" id="Denmark">Denmark</span> and <span class="location Norway"  id="Norway">Norway</span>. 
                                        The next month, the troops moved on to <span class="location Holland" id="Holland">Holland</span>, 
                                        <span class="location Belgium" id="Belgium">Belgium</span>, and finally <span class="location France" id="France">France</span>. German tanks covered 240 miles of challenging terrain, 
                                        including the Ardennes Forest, in 11 days, bypassing the entrenched British and French forced who had 
                                        mistakenly assumed the Ardennes was impassable. Paratroopers sometimes landed ahead of the advance, 
                                        causing chaos behind enemy lines; the British press described these soldiers as “heavily drugged, fearless and berserk.”</p>
                                    
                                    <p><span class="GeneralGuderian">General Heinz Guderian</span>, an expert in tank warfare and leader of the invasion, gave the order to speed ahead 
                                        to the French border: “I demand that you go sleepless for at least three nights if that should be necessary.” 
                                        When they crossed into <span class="location France" id="France">France</span>, French reinforcements had yet to arrive, and their defenses were overwhelmed by the German attack.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“I was dumbfounded,” <a class="lod" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill"><span class="Churchill">Churchill</span></a> wrote in his memoirs. “I had never expected to have to face…the overrunning 
                                        of the whole communications and countryside by an irresistible incursion of armoured vehicles…I admit it 
                                        was one of the greatest surprises I have had in my life.” The speed of the attack was jaw-dropping. 
                                        High on <span class="Pervitin">Pervitin</span>, German tank and artillery drivers covered ground night and day, almost without stopping. 
                                        Foreign commanders and civilians alike were caught entirely off guard.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Some users reported negative side effects of the drug. During the French invasion, these included a lieutenant 
                                        colonel with the Panzer Ersatz Division I, who experienced heart pains after taking <span class="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> four times 
                                        daily for as many weeks; the commander of the Twelfth Tank Division, who rushed to a military hospital due to 
                                        the heart attacked he suffered an hour after taking one pill; and several officers who suffered heart attacks while 
                                        off duty after taking <span class="Pervitin">Pervitin</span>.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Amid growing worries about the addictive potential and negative side effects of overusing the drug, 
                                        the German military began to cut back on allocations of <span class="methamphetamine">methamphetamines</span> by the end of <span class="y1940">1940</span>. 
                                        Consumption declined sharply in 1941 and 1942, when the medical establishment formally acknowledged that <span class="amphetamine">amphetamines</span> were addictive.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Nevertheless, the drug continued to be dispensed on both the western and eastern fronts. 
                                        Temmler-Wenke, the maker of the drug, remained as profitable as ever, despite rising awareness of the negative health effects.</p>
