                                                Union General <span id="BenjaminButler">Benjamin Butler</span> was baffled. 
                                                Every night a picket guard went to an outpost 1½ miles 
                                                from <span class="location" id="FortMonroe">Fort Monroe</span>, 
                                                <span class="location" id="Virginia">Virginia</span>. 
                                                The soldiers departed for their shift perfectly sober, 
                                                yet when they returned to the post the next morning they
                                                caused trouble “on account of being drunk.” Investigations 
                                                failed to reveal the source of their <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>. 
                                                Searches of canteens and gear turned up nothing suspicious. 
                                                But there was one odd thing about the detachment: someone in <span id="BenjaminButler">Butler</span>’s
                                                command noticed that the men always held their muskets straight up in a 
                                                peculiar manner. The mystery unraveled when their muskets were examined. 
                                                “Every gun barrel,” wrote Butler, “was found to be filled with <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>.”

                                                to army camps on both sides by well-meaning relatives back home. 
                                                It was a common practice, especially among the Union soldiers, for 
                                                families to send their loved ones packages of fresh, canned, or smoked
                                                food and other small creature comforts. Commanding officers quickly realized 
                                                that a great deal of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> was also being smuggled into

                                                One favorite ruse was hiding

                                                The bottles were sold wholesale at eight cents each, but soldiers paid 25 cents for them in camp.

                                                to cut the naval ration to one gill, or four ounces, daily. Sailors under the age of 21 and anyone who chose not to

                                                One of the few effective <span id="drug">drugs</span> of the era, <span id="quinine">quinine</span>, could prevent <span id="malaria">malaria</span> or ease symptoms for patients who already had the disease. Soldiers often balked at taking their <span id="malaria">malaria</span> medicine, though, because of its markedly bitter taste. To cajole soldiers into taking <span id="quinine">quinine</span>, some surgeons mixed it with <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>. This created the opposite problem; some soldiers enjoyed the <span id="quinine">quinine</span>-<span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> dose so much that they sneaked through the line for a second prescription. While stationed at <span class="location" id="NewBern_NorthCarolina">New Bern, North Carolina</span>, the men of the <span id="44thMassachusetts">44th Massachusetts</span> found that their medical officers took precautions to limit the soldiers to one dose each. Instead of serving <span id="quinine">quinine</span> in <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>, the <span id="drug">drug</span> came blended with medical <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span>, water, and cayenne pepper. “No soldier,” wrote a veteran of the regiment, “is known to have acquired a dangerous hankering for the mixture.”

                                                Drunkenness could be overlooked if it occurred when a soldier was off duty and did not compound his offense with other crimes. Court-martial of officers charged with drunkenness was handled differently from those of enlisted men. Officers found guilty could be cashiered with forfeiture of pay. In addition to dismissal, a Confederate law of <span id="1862">1862</span> allowed a public reprimand of officers convicted of drunkenness. An officer dismissed from the Confederate service could also be
                                                conscripted back into the ranks as an enlisted man. Enlisted personnel found guilty of drunkenness usually faced some form of confinement, corporal punishment, or public shaming. Penalties varied depending on the degree of the soldier’s offense and the policies of his commanding officer. Common punishments for drunken enlisted men included confinement in a guard tent or guardhouse, wearing a barrel with a placard noting that the culprit was a drunk, extra duty, or a spell carrying a log or marching with a knapsack filled with rocks.

After the injuries were set and bandaged, the soldier remained in excruciating pain and his condition worsened. Checking the patient, <span id="PhoebeYatesPember">Pember</span> found that the bandaged leg was perfectly healthy, while the other leg was “swollen, inflamed, and purple.” The attending surgeon had been so drunk that he set the wrong leg. Fever set in and the patient died at the hospital.

                                                On <span id="21October1863">October 21, 1863</span>, the <span id="CharlestonCourier">Charleston Courier</span> published a recipe for persimmon <span id="brandy">brandy</span>. Mashed by a pestle or simply with one’s hands, persimmons were mixed with warm water and left to ferment for five or six days. Then the mash was ready for distillation. In thrifty fashion, the writer suggested saving the persimmon seeds. They could be used for buttons, or parched and mixed with dried sweet potatoes to make a coffee substitute. <span id="beer">Beer</span> and <span id="wine">wine</span> were simpler to make at home than <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>, as they needed no distilling apparatus. Newspapers published numerous recipes for persimmon <span id="beer">beer</span>. <span id="wine">Wine</span> and <span id="brandy">brandy</span> were made from any kind of available fruit, including peaches, pears, cherries, blackberries, plums, and even
                                                watermelons.

                                                Plagued with food shortages, inflation, and transportation problems, Southern soldiers and civilians dealt with severe shortages of <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> caused by state legislatures restricting the use of grain, corn and foodstuffs for distilled <span id="liquor">liquor</span>. Private distilling took a blow after the Federal capture of <span class="location" id="Chattanooga">Chattanooga</span> in <span id="September1863">September 1863</span> and advancing Union forces captured copper mines desperately needed by the South. Not only did their loss crimp production of brass artillery pieces, it also threatened the manufacture of percussion caps and artillery friction primers. The <span id="ConfederateOrdnanceBureau">Confederate Ordnance Bureau</span> confiscated scores of copper <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> stills in western <span class="location" id="NorthCarolina">North Carolina</span>. Metal from the stills went into many of the South’s

                                        <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> control. Yet this war was crucial in the establishment
                                        of a system of international control for <span id="drug">drugs</span> that still
                                        endures today. It instituted models of control for <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> that
                                        also had a lengthy life. In 2014, the First World War is still a
                                        potent presence so far as drugs and <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> are concerned.
                                        International <span id="drug">drug</span> control had been discussed before the
                                        war, but a global system was unlikely. The major initiative
                                        had come from the Americans in the <span  id="early1900s">early 1900s</span>, driven by
                                        twin motives of moral regulation and strategic advantage
                                        in the <span class="location" id="FarEast">Far East</span>. The Americans believed that “civilising” and
                                        converting the <span id="Chinese">Chinese</span> would come through the ending of
                                        their <span id="opium">opium</span> consumption. Missionaries and the <span id="USStateDepartment">US State Department</span> 
                                        had trained their sights on the <span id="IndoChineseOpiumTrade">Indo-Chinese opium 
                                        trade</span>, a trade which civil servants in the <span id="BritishForeignOffice">British Foreign Office</span> 
                                        were already bringing to a close. 
                                        The <span id="ShanghaiConvention">Shanghai Convention</span> of <span id="1909">1909</span> 
                                        retained a Far Eastern focus, but
                                        afterwards the compass of potential control widened. There
                                        was genuine concern in the <span id="BritishForeignOffice">British Foreign Office</span> about
                                        <span id="morphine">morphine</span> and <span id="cocaine">cocaine</span> smuggling in southeast <span id="Asia">Asia</span> 
                                        and this topic was taken up by the Americans as an important part of
                                        the international control agenda. The <span id="HagueConvention">Hague Convention</span> 
                                        of <span id="1912">1912</span> was the product of this expanded geographical concern. 
                                        The decision at the <span id="HagueConvention">Hague</span> that <span id="opium">opium</span>,

                                        to “legitimate medical purposes” was central to future international <span id="drug">drug</span> control. 
                                        Earlier enquiries, such
                                        as the <span id="IndianRoyalCommissionOpium">Indian Royal Commission on Opium</span> of <span id="1895">1895</span>, 
                                        had defended medical and non-medical use, and indeed had taken the view that it was difficult to 
                                        distinguish one type of use from the other. But there were further complications about extending control. 
                                        The <span id="GermanGovernment">German Government</span> refused to adhere to the <span id="HagueConvention">Convention</span> 
                                        because it might be only partially applied and therefore damage the German <span id="cocaine">cocaine</span> industry; 
                                        it insisted that all 34 participating powers had to ratify the <span id="HagueConvention">Hague Convention</span> before
                                        it could come into force.
                                        The convention thus had an “all or nothing” aspect that had not been initially intended. As the 
                                        <span id="BritishDelegates">British Delegates</span> wrote in their Report, “It [the convention] has, 
                                        for the first time, laid down as a principle of international morality that the various countries concerned cannot 
                                        stand alone in these measures.” The German proviso was a delaying tactic and so only those countries 
                                        committed to further controls went ahead before the outbreak of war. The <span class="location" id="USA">USA</span> 
                                        was one, keen to take a prohibitionist stance. The <span id="USHarrisonAct">US Harrison Act</span> 
                                        of <span id="1914">1914</span>, a revenue measure, aimed to restrict access to <span id="drug">drugs</span> and to
                                        “stamp out” addiction. Other countries were less keen and by the outbreak of the <span  id="FirstWorldWar">First World War</span>,
                                        there had been only eight ratifications. In the <span class="location" id="UK">UK</span>, rather 
                                        desultory discussions before the war envisaged simply an extension of existing pharmacy controls and possibly 
                                        some further restrictions on the dispensing of doctors’ prescriptions. The <span  id="FirstWorldWar">war</span> 
                                        changed the situation. In the <span class="location" id="UK">UK</span>, it brought the 
                                        <span id="Home Office">Home Office</span> in <span id="2014">2014</span> still the lead department 
                                        for drug policy—into a central role and also more stringent restriction onto the agenda. Two issues caused concern. 
                                        Smuggling of <span id="drug">drugs</span> showed that controls were indeed interdependent at the international level. 
                                        The <span class="location" id="UK">UK</span> was the world’s major manufacturer of <span id="morphine">morphine</span> 
                                        and the exported <span id="drug">drug</span> was being diverted into <span class="location" id="China">China</span> 
                                        via <span class="location" id="Japan">Japan</span>. The <span id="HomeOffice">Home Office</span> introduced a 
                                        system of import/export certification designed to ensure that all shipments out of the country had a legitimate 
                                        destination. <span id="morphine">Morphine</span> was the main smuggled <span id="drug">drug</span> but the use 
                                        of <span id="cocaine">cocaine</span> also seemed to be expanding in some of the combatant countries. 
                                        It was feared that army effi ciency was at risk. In the <span class="location" id="UK">UK</span>, the 
                                        <span id="drugscare">“drug scare”</span> first arose in <span class="location" id="Folkestone">Folkestone</span> 
                                        with sales to Canadian soldiers billeted there. Then the <span class="location" id="WestEnd">West End</span>
                                        of <span class="location" id="London">London</span> became the focus; 
                                        there were fears that sex workers and others were selling <span id="drug">drugs</span> to soldiers. 
                                        Pharmacy laws were powerless to stop the trade despite some attempts at prosecution. 
                                        <span id="TheDailyChronicle">The Daily Chronicle</span>
                                        expressed the fears of the time. ‘It <span id="cocaine">[cocaine]</span> is driving hundreds of 
                                        women mad. What is worse, it will drive, unless the traffic in it is checked,
                                        hundreds of soldiers mad.” The <span id="UKGovernment">UK Government</span> passed emergency

                                        regulation 40B, which tightened domestic controls. It made non-medical possession an offence and required a doctor’s prescription 
                                        for <span id="cocaine">cocaine</span>. <span id="Germany">Germany</span>, <span id="Canada">Canada</span>, and other

                                    <h2>Perspectives</h2>
                                    <p>A later enquiry concluded that there was, in fact, very little recreational

                                        but by then restriction had taken on a life of its own. <span id="Article295">Article 295</span> 
                                        of the peace settlement enacted through the <span id="TreatyVersailles">Treaty of Versailles</span> in <span id="1919">1919</span> 
                                        brought the <span id="HagueConvention">Hague Convention</span> into operation and gave the newly established 
                                        <span id="LeagueNations">League of Nations</span> general supervision over international narcotics agreements. 
                                        At the <span id="firstLeagueAssembly">first League Assembly</span>, 
                                        an <span id="AdvisoryCommittee">Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium and other Dangerous Drugs</span> 
                                        was created, its initial members the European countries with colonial <span id="opium">opium</span> monopolies. 
                                        The <span  id="FirstWorldWar">war</span> had swept away prewar difficulties about ratification and brought worldwide control. 
                                        By the <span id="mid1920s">mid-1920s</span> international drug control had become what the US historian 
                                        <span id="WilliamMcAllister">William McAllister</span> calls a “going concern”. 
                                        A full control machinery covered manufacture, trade in, and distribution of addictive substances, 
                                        with an import/export certificate system based on the British model. <span id="cannabis">Cannabis</span> was brought 
                                        into the system in the <span id="1920s">1920s</span>. <span class="alcohol">Alcohol</span> control, like <span id="opium">opium</span>, 
                                        was also a matter of international concern before the <span  id="FirstWorldWar">war</span>. 
                                        But the <span  id="FirstWorldWar">war</span> did not lead to a similar international convention, 
                                        only a regional system which covered colonies in <span id="Africa">Africa</span>. 
                                        <span  id="FirstWorldWar">War</span> nevertheless had a longstanding impact at the national level. 
                                        British and American forms of control were different. In the <span class="location" id="UK">UK</span>, 
                                        concerns about the impact of <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> on the <span  id="FirstWorldWar">war</span> 
                                        effort brought central state regulation. The drink issue was adroitly used by <span id="LloydGeorge">Lloyd George</span> as 
                                        <span id="MinisterMunitions">Minister of Munitions</span> and at one stage he considered wholesale state purchase of the 
                                        drink trade. Drink nationalisation was not practical politics and instead a <span id="CCB">Central Control Board (CCB)</span> 
                                        was set up in <span id="1915">1915</span>. It was given wide powers to regulate and even to purchase the trade in key 
                                        military and naval areas and its overall powers extended to the whole country by <span id="1916">1916</span>. 
                                        The <span id="CCB">CCB</span> limited the hours of consumption and introduced the famous <span id="afternooGap">“afternoon gap”</span>, 
                                        when pubs and clubs had to close. “Off” sales of spirits were prohibited in the evenings and at weekends and their 
                                        strength was reduced. Servicemen had been plied with drinks in pubs so “treating” (buying rounds) was forbidden. 
                                        The <span id="CCB">CCB</span>, chaired by <span id="ViscountAbernon">Viscount D’Abernon</span>, 
                                        had a research committee and was concerned to base its actions on scientific evidence. 
                                        State control of the trade was introduced in certain key military areas <span id="EnfieldLock">Enfield Lock</span> near 
                                        <span class="location" id="London">London</span>, and the <span class="location" id="Carlisle">Carlisle</span> area. 
                                        Industrial canteens were established. The <span id="CCB">CCB</span> even set up its own pubs and the war thus 
                                        brought the introduction of a system which had been widely discussed 
                                        before war—<span id="disinterestedmanagementpubs"> ”disinterested management”—pubs</span> run not for a profit, 
                                        under state control. Statistics showed that such policies, which were widely accepted by the public, 
                                        had an impact on measures of harm from <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span>, such as deaths from 
                                        <span id="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</span> of the liver and arrests for drunkenness. 
                                        By the early <span id="1920s">1920s</span> per capita        
                                        spirit consumption in the <span class="location" id="UK">UK</span> had halved from its 
                                        prewar level and beer consumption also declined. Convictions        
                                        for drunkenness fell from more than 130 000 to just over 29 000 per year. 
                                        Unlike <span id="drug control">drug control</span>, this overall system of 
                                        <span id="alcohol control">alcohol control</span> did not persist into the postwar years. 
                                        Central control was abandoned, although some elements of the war time system remained in existence. 
                                        In the <span class="location" id="USA">USA</span>, by contrast, war time restrictions 
                                        led to national prohibition enacted in <span id="1920">1920</span>. 
                                        That system lasted only until <span id="1929">1929</span>, but like war time controls in 
                                        the <span class="location" id="UK">UK</span> it affected patterns of drinking with a move towards 
                                        spirit drinking and a decline in <span id="beer">beer</span> consumption. 
                                        It came to an end not because prohibition “failed” but because industrial and 
                                        business interests, which had once supported it, removed their support as the <span id="GreatDepression">Great Depression</span> 
                                        took hold. <span id="Prohibition">Prohibition</span> in the 
                                        <span class="location" id="USA">USA</span> was the best known of efforts 
                                        by a number of countries to introduce similar systems. 
                                        <span id="Iceland">Iceland</span> and <span id="Finland">Finland</span> had already brought in prohibition; 
                                        <span id="Canada">Canada</span> and <span id="Norway">Norway</span> had partial prohibition. 
                                        <span id="Russia">Russia</span> established prohibition during the war while 
                                        <span id="Sweden">Sweden</span> voted in favour but never actually put it into practice. 
                                        Further attempts to take controls through the <span id="LeagueNations">League of Nations</span> fell foul of the French, 
                                        representing the interests of the <span id="FrenchWineIndustry">French wine industry</span>. 
                                        There was what <span id="MarkSchrad">Mark Schrad</span> has called a 
                                        <span id="globalprohibitionwave">“global prohibition wave”</span> drawing on 
                                        prewar temperance interests and catalysed by the war effort. But these attempts ultimately failed. 
                                        For <span id="drug">drugs</span>, a system with its origin in the needs of the colonial powers was 
                                        later to be dominated by the <span class="location" id="USA">USA</span>. The system in the 
                                        <span id="FirstWorldWar">First World War</span> morphed into the <span id="UnitedNations">United Nations</span> 
                                        control machinery after the <span id="SecondWorldWar">Second World War</span>, where it still remains today. 
                                        Now former colonial countries in <span id="South America">South America</span> are testing the boundaries of the system 
                                        in order to accommodate the culturally sanctioned use of <span id="drug">drugs</span> such as <span id="cocaine">coca</span>. 
                                        But it would be premature to hail the demise of the <span  id="FirstWorldWar">Great War</span> system. 
                                        The <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> restrictions also cast a lengthy shadow—state control lasted in 
                                        <span class="location" id="Carlisle">Carlisle</span> until the early <span id="1970s">1970s</span> 
                                        and the afternoon gap until <span id="1987">1987</span>. 
                                        Now the <span id="UK Government">UK Government</span>’s 
                                        <span id="PublicHealthResponsibilityDeal">Public Health Responsibility Deal</span> is taking 
                                        on some of the same issues, for example, reduction of the strength of <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span>. 
                                        That deal has controversially brought industry and some public health interests 
                                        together in a way also prefigured by the <span id="CCB">CCB</span>, which had industry and temperance members, 
                                        although their alliance did not outlive the war. The war time restrictions on <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> still 
                                        stand as an example of what government regulation can achieve in improving health and reducing crime. For both 
                                        <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span> and <span id="drug">drugs</span>, the <span  id="FirstWorldWar">First World War</span> 
                                        was an external shock, initiating systems and developments that might never otherwise have come about.

                                    <p>In The Art of War, <span id="SunTzu">Sun Tzu</span> wrote that speed is “the essence of war.” 
                                        While he of course did not have <span id="amphetamine">amphetamines</span> in mind, he would no doubt have been impressed by their 
                                        powerful war-facilitating psychoactive effects. <span id="amphetamine">Amphetamines</span>—often called “pep pills,” “go pills,” “uppers” 
                                        or <span id="speed">“speed”</span>—are a group of synthetic drugs that stimulate the central nervous system, reducing fatigue and appetite 
                                        and increasing wakefulness and a sense of well-being. The quintessential drug of the modern industrial age, 
                                        <span id="amphetamine">amphetamines</span> arrived relatively late in the history of mind-altering substances—commercialized just in time 
                                        for mass consumption during World War II by the leading industrial powers. That war was not only the most 
                                        destructive war in human history but also the most pharmacologically enhanced. It was literally sped up by <span id="speed">speed</span>.</p>

                                    <p>Few drugs have received a bigger stimulus from war. 
                                        As <span id="LesterGrinspoon">Lester Grinspoon</span> and <span id="PeterHedblom">Peter Hedblom</span> wrote in their classic 1975 study The <span id="speed">Speed</span> Culture, 
                                        “World War II probably gave the greatest impetus to date to legal medically authorized as well as 
                                        illicit black market abuse of these pills on a worldwide scale.”
                                        Japanese, American and British forces consumed large amounts of <span id="amphetamine">amphetamines</span>, 
                                        but the Germans were the most enthusiastic early adopters, pioneering pill-popping on the battlefield 
                                        during the initial phases of the war.</p>

                                    <p><span id="Nazi">Nazi</span> ideology was fundamentalist in its antidrug stance. 
                                        Social use of drugs was considered both a sign of personal weakness 
                                        and a symbol of the country’s moral decay in the wake of a traumatic and humiliating defeat in World War I.</p>
                                        <a href="#Nazi">Nazi</a>
                                    
                                    <p>But as <span id="NormanOhler">Norman Ohler</span> shows in Blitzed: Drugs in <span id="Nazi">Nazi</span> <span class="location" id="Germany">Germany</span>, 
                                        <span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> was the privileged exception. While other drugs were banned or discouraged, 
                                        <span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> was touted as a miracle product when it appeared on the market 
                                        in the late <span id="decade1930">1930s</span>. 
                                        Indeed, the little pill was the perfect <span id="Nazi">Nazi</span> drug: “<span class="location" id="Germany">Germany</span>, awake!” 
                                        the <span id="Nazi">Nazis</span> had commanded. 
                                        Energizing and confidence boosting, <span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> 
                                        played into the Third Reich’s obsession with physical and mental superiority. 
                                        In sharp contrast to drugs such as <span id="heroin">heroin</span> or <span class="alcohol">alcohol</span>, 
                                        <span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamines</span> were not about escapist pleasure. 
                                        Rather, they were taken for hyper-alertness and vigilance. Aryans, who were the embodiment of 
                                        human perfection in <span id="Nazi">Nazi</span> ideology, could now even aspire to be superhuman—and such 
                                        superhumans could be turned into supersoldiers. 
                                        “We don’t need weak people,” Hitler declared, “we want only the strong!” Weak people took 
                                        drugs such as <span id="opium">opium</span> to escape; 
                                        strong people took <span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> to feel even stronger.</p>

                                    <p>The German chemist <span id="FriedrichHauschild">Friedrich Hauschild</span> had been aware of the American <span id="amphetamine">amphetamine</span> Benzedrine 
                                        ever since the drug has been used as a doping product in the Olympic Games in Berlin in <span id="decade1930">1936</span>. 
                                        The following year he managed to synthesize <span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span>, a close cousin of 
                                        <span id="amphetamine">amphetamine</span>, while working 
                                        for Temmler-Werke, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company. Temmler-Werke began selling <span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> under 
                                        the brand name <span id="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> in the winter of <span id="decade1930">1937</span>. 
                                        Partly thanks to the company’s aggressive advertising campaign, 
                                        <span id="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> became well known within a few months. The tablets were wildly popular 
                                        and could be purchased without a
                                        prescription in pharmacies. One could even buy boxed chocolates spiked with <span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span>. 
                                        But the drug’s
                                        most important use was yet to come.</p>

                                    <p>Dr. <span id="OttoRanke">Otto F. Ranke</span>, director of the Research Institute of Defense Physiology, 
                                        had high hopes that <span id="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> would prove advantageous on the battlefield. 
                                        His goal was to defeat the enemy with chemically enhanced soldiers, soldiers who could give <span class="location" id="Germany">Germany</span> a military edge 
                                        by fighting harder and longer than 
                                        their opponents. After testing the drug on a group of medical officers, Ranke believed the <span id="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> would be 
                                        “an excellent substance for rousing a weary squad… We may grasp what far-reaching military significance it would 
                                        have if we managed to remove the natural tiredness using medical methods.”</p>

                                    <p><span id="OttoRanke">Ranke</span> himself was a daily user, as detailed in his wartime medical diary and letters: 
                                        “With <span id="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> you can go on working for 36 to 50 hours without feeling any noticeable fatigue.” 
                                        This allowed <span id="OttoRanke">Ranke</span> to work days at a time with no sleep. And his correspondence indicated that a 
                                        growing number of officers were doing the same thing—popping pills to manage the demands of their jobs.</p>

                                    <p>Wehrmacht medical officers administered <span id="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> to soldiers of the Third Tank Division 
                                        during the occupation of <span class="location" id="Czecholslovakia">Czecholslovakia</span> in <span id="decade1930">1938</span>. 
                                        But the invasion of <span class="location" id="Poland">Poland</span> in <span id="decade1930">September 1939</span> served as the first real military test of the drug in the field. 
                                        <span class="location" id="Germany">Germany</span> overran its eastern neighbor by October, with 100,000 Polish soldiers killed in the attack. 
                                        The invasion introduced a new form of industrialized warfare, Blitzkrieg. This “lightning war” 
                                        emphasized speed and surprise, catching the enemy off guard by the unprecedented quickness of 
                                        the mechanized attack and advance. The weak link in the Blitzkrieg strategy was the soldiers, 
                                        who were humans rather than machines and as such suffered from fatigue. 
                                        They required regular rest and sleep, which, of course, slowed down the military advance.
                                        That is where <span id="Pervitin">Pervitin</span> came in—part of the speed of the Blitzkrieg literally came from <span id="speed">speed</span>. 
                                        As medical historian <span id="PeterSteinkamp">Peter Steinkamp</span> puts it, “Blitzkrieg was guided by <span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span>. 
                                        If not to say that Blitzkrieg was founded on <span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span>.”</p>

                                    <p>In <span id="decade1930">late 1939</span> and early <span id="1940">1940</span>, <span id="LeoConti">Leo Conti</span>, the “Reich Health Führer,” and others sounded the alarm bells 
                                        about the risk of <span id="Pervitin">Pervitin</span>, resulting in the drug being made available by prescription only. 
                                        But these warnings largely fell on deaf ears, and the new regulations were widely ignored. 
                                        Use of the drug continued to grow. At the Temmler-Werke factory, production revved into overdrive, 
                                        pressing as many as 833,000 tablets per day. Between April and July <span id="1940">1940</span>, German servicemen received 
                                        more than 35 million <span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> tablets. The drug was even dispensed to pilots and tank 
                                        crews in the form of chocolate bars known as Fliegerschokolade (flyer’s chocolate) and Panzerschokolade (tanker’s chocolate).</p>

                                    <p>Armies had long consumed various psychoactive substances, but this was the first large-scale 
                                        use of a synthetic performance-enhancing drug. Historian <span id="ShelbyStanton">Shelby Stanton</span> comments: 
                                        “They dispensed it to the line troops. Ninety percent of their army had to march on foot, 
                                        day and night. It was more important for them to keep punching during the Blitzkrieg than to get a good night’s sleep. 
                                        The whole damn army was hopped up. It was one of the secrets of Blitzkrieg.”</p>

                                    <p>The Blitzkreig depended on <span id="speed">speed</span>, relentlessly pushing ahead with tank troops, day and night. 
                                        In April <span id="1940">1940</span>, it quickly led to the fall of <span class="location" id="Denmark">Denmark</span> and <span class="location" id="Norway">Norway</span>. 
                                        The next month, the troops moved on to <span class="location" id="Holland">Holland</span>, 
                                        <span class="location" id="Belgium">Belgium</span>, and finally <span class="location" id="France">France</span>. German tanks covered 240 miles of challenging terrain, 
                                        including the Ardennes Forest, in 11 days, bypassing the entrenched British and French forced who had 
                                        mistakenly assumed the Ardennes was impassable. Paratroopers sometimes landed ahead of the advance, 
                                        causing chaos behind enemy lines; the British press described these soldiers as “heavily drugged, fearless and berserk.”</p>

                                        to the French border: “I demand that you go sleepless for at least three nights if that should be necessary.” 
                                        When they crossed into <span class="location" id="France">France</span>, French reinforcements had yet to arrive, and their defenses were overwhelmed by the German attack.</p>

                                        Foreign commanders and civilians alike were caught entirely off guard.</p>

                                    <p>Some users reported negative side effects of the drug. During the French invasion, these included a lieutenant

                                        daily for as many weeks; the commander of the Twelfth Tank Division, who rushed to a military hospital due to 
                                        the heart attacked he suffered an hour after taking one pill; and several officers who suffered heart attacks while

                                        the German military began to cut back on allocations of <span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamines</span> by the end of <span id="1940">1940</span>. 
                                        Consumption declined sharply in 1941 and 1942, when the medical establishment formally acknowledged that <span id="amphetamine">amphetamines</span> were addictive.</p>

                                    <p>Nevertheless, the drug continued to be dispensed on both the western and eastern fronts. 
                                        Temmler-Wenke, the maker of the drug, remained as profitable as ever, despite rising awareness of the negative health effects.</p>
