Furthermore, the fanzine drew inspiration from Sniffin Glue's collage style, reappropriating existing cultural elements to create a unique and ideologically charged visual language. This demonstrates how Sniffin Glue's typographic innovation and rebellious spirit transcended its immediate context, influencing and shaping the style of fanzines throughout the 80s and beyond.</p>

            <h5 id="y2030" class="mb-3 mt-1" >the Future: 2030</h5>

            <p class="animated-text" data-value='For the 2030&apos;s style, the possibilities were almost <span class="text-brutal">endless</span>. Since I wanted to combine both a design that was beautiful to look at and one that was easy/pragmatic to use, I almost immediately abandoned any kind of retro-futuristic, post-apocalyptic or dystopian inspiration. What I had in mind aligned perfectly with a TV series called <a href="https://www.hudsandguis.com/home/2021/theexpanse">"The Epanse"</a> which explores a future neither too near nor too far, in which mankind is now a permanent visitor to almost every planet, moon, asteroid in the solar system. 
            So stable of a frequenter that in the course of generations, the different portions of humans who have now left Earth have begun to experience generational changes due to the difference in gravity, the lack of direct sunlight and all those things that Earthlings take for granted. Mars declared its independence and so did "The Belt", all those moons, asteroids and small planets in the outer belt of the solar system. Without delving further into the complex plot of this TV series, what can be seen immediately is that red and black are the most present colours. 
            This is because I wanted to choose the faction of the Martians as the "faction", since in the economy of this TV series, <span class="text-brutal">the Martians</span> are the most technologically advanced faction as they are constantly driven by a war economy.

Black remains the dominant colour, as a reminder of deep space. Besides colours, elements that render the idea of the future pretty well are effects obtained with JavaScript. I chose to use these effect only on the homepage in order to avoid an overload of scripts that could distract the user from the main content of the page. 
            These effects are visible if you hover over the main title of the web page with the mouse cursor, it will start its animation which will end within a few seconds. Similarly when selecting this style the paragraphs of the documentation are generated automatically, simulating the behaviour of LLM interfaces such as Chat-gpt when generating text in response to a prompt given by a user. The inclusion of this typical behaviour of AI interfaces is in some ways a reminder of what will be a probable future as already by now in 2023, the <span class="text-brutal">exponential development</span> of this type of technology has only scratched the surface of what may be its, virtually infinite, applications.
            Elements such as these that i have just mentioned not only can offer an appealing visual imprint of the home page, but also are present, to some extent, in the Tv-series that remain still to the position of main inspiration for this theme.'>

            In any case, both effects mentioned so far are applied only to the homepage, despite a future in which the issues of a magazine, the articles of a newspaper, or any other type of textual information will most likely be created on the fly by generative models is not so far from us. I chose to prioritize the readability of issues since, unlike documentation, they are much longer, and their arrangement in two columns would have created an unpleasant visual effect. I chose a two-column layout to emulate what is often seen in <span class="text-brutal">The Expanse</span>, especially on the personal devices of each character in the series. The information frequently read through these devices is arranged in one or, at most, two columns. 
            When the amount of text is substantial, it is often divided into two columns, which is why I opted to arrange the text in this manner. In the image below, you can see an example of this. The colors of this device are different because they belong to a prominent figure in the Earth faction, hence the predominant blue on his device.
