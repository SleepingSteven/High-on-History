    <title>Forty-rod, Blue Ruin & Oh Be Joyful: Civil War Alcohol Abuse</title>

    With a plethora of colorful nicknames, <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> was widely abused in 
    both <span id="Union">Union</span> and <span id="Confederate">Confederate</span> armies 
    during the <span id="CivilWar">Civil War</span>.

    Union General <span id="BenjaminButler">Benjamin Butler</span> was baffled. 
    Every night a picket guard went to an outpost 1½ miles 
    from <span class="location" id="FortMonroe">Fort Monroe</span>, 
    <span class="location" id="Virginia">Virginia</span>. 
    The soldiers departed for their shift perfectly sober, 
    yet when they returned to the post the next morning they
    caused trouble “on account of being drunk.” Investigations 
    failed to reveal the source of their <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>. 
    Searches of canteens and gear turned up nothing suspicious. 
    But there was one odd thing about the detachment: someone in <span id="BenjaminButler">Butler</span>’s
    command noticed that the men always held their muskets straight up in a 
    peculiar manner. The mystery unraveled when their muskets were examined. 
    “Every gun barrel,” wrote Butler, “was found to be filled with <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>.”

    Excessive drinking was a constant problem in both armies during 
    the <span id="CivilWar">Civil War</span>. 
    “No one evil agent so much obstructs this army as the degrading vice of drunkenness,” 
    wrote <span id="GenGeorgMcClellan">Union Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan</span> 
    in <span id="February1862">February 1862</span>. “It is the
    cause of by far the greatest part of the disorders which are examined by court-martial.” 
    The complete abolition of <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span>, he believed, “would be 
    worth fifty thousand men to the armies of the <span class="location" id="UnitedStates">United States</span>.”
    And across the <span id="MasonDixonLine">Mason-Dixon Line</span>,
    the <span id="NorfolkDayBook">Norfolk Day-Book</span> complained that Confederate 
    enlisted men and officers in the vicinity were drinking <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> 
    “in quantities which would astonish the nerves of a cast-iron lamp-post, 
    and of a quality which would destroy the digestive organs of an ostrich.”

<h2><span id="whiskey">Whiskey</span> the Drink of Choice for Most Soldiers</h2>
<p>Many if not most soldiers were already well acquainted with 
    <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> from the antebellum era. 
    <span id="whiskey">Whiskey</span> was far and away the most popular drink 
    in <span id="1861">1861</span>. Often made from corn instead of grain, 
    it was distilled at countless locations across the country. 
    Popular nondistilled drinks included <span id="cider">cider</span> and 
    <span id="beer">beer</span>. <span id="cider">Cider</span>, made from apples, 
    was more common, but <span id="beer">beer</span> was quickly growing in favor, 
    its rise fueled by the steady German immigration into 
    <span class="location" id="NorthernStates">Northern states</span>.

<p>
    Low-grade <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> carried with it the threat of poisoning the drinker, 
    so makers might start with clear <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span>, water it down, 
    and then doctor the mixture to simulate the color and flavor of the real thing. 
    Chewing <span id="tobacco">tobacco</span>, for example,
    helped approximate the amber tint of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> or <span id="brandy">brandy</span>. 
    Harsher ingredients added the bite that drinkers expected in their <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>. 
    An 1860 inspection of <span id="liquor">liquor</span> samples in <span class="location" id="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</span> 
    found <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> containing <span id="sulfuricAcid">sulfuric acid</span>,

    <span id="caustic">caustic</span>, <span id="soda">soda</span>, 
    <span id="potassium">potassium</span>, and <span id="strychnine">strychnine</span>. 
    It was no wonder that <span id="rotgut">“rotgut”</span> was the most prevalent nickname 
    for cheap <span id="liquor">liquor</span> during the era.

    Countering the growth of <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> consumption was the temperance 
    movement, which sought to make all forms of alcoholic beverages illegal. <span class="location" id="Maine">Maine</span> 
    enacted a prohibition law in <span id="1851">1851</span>. Several other states or 
    territories passed dry laws in the
    following years. In most cases, these laws were repealed or overturned within a short time. 
    Per capita consumption peaked in <span id="1830">1830</span> at an equivalent of 7.1 gallons 
    of <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> annually. A swift decline followed, with the annual per capita figure
    dropping to 2.53 gallons by <span id="1860">1860</span>.

<h2>“<span id="spirit">Spirit</span> Rations” Abolished</h2>
<a href="#spirit">Spirit</a>

<p>
    <span id="alcohol">Alcohol</span> still had an official presence in the <span id="USArmy">U.S. Army</span> 
    in <span id="1861">1861</span>. A daily <span id="spirit">spirit</span> ration for American soldiers 
    had been abolished in <span id="1832">1832</span>, but officers were permitted to 
    issue special servings of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> to relieve fatigue and exposure. 
    Soldiers, naturally, had countless sneaky ways to obtain <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>. 
    While diligent officers could restrict the flow of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> into camp, 
    soldiers could still drink when they received a pass to leave camp. In the <span id="ConfederateArmy">Confederate Army</span>, 
    the phrase “running the blockade” meant slipping in and out of camp for illicit purposes, 
    usually involving <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span>.

    On <span id="27February1862">February 27, 1862</span>, 
    the <span id="ConfederateCongress">Confederate Congress</span> passed a law allowing 
    <span id="PresidentDavis">President Jefferson Davis</span> to suspend habeas corpus and 
    declare martial law in areas threatened by the enemy. Immediately, martial law was declared 
    in <span class="location" id="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</span> and
    <span class="location" id="Norfolk">Norfolk</span>, <span class="location" id="Virginia">Virginia</span>, 
    followed by <span class="location" id="Richmond">Richmond</span> on <span id="March 1">March 1</span>. 
    <span class="location" id="Richmond">Richmond</span> came under control of the provost guards commanded 
    by <span id="GenWinder">Brig. Gen. John H. Winder</span>, who prohibited 
    the manufacture of <span id="liquor">liquor</span> and closed the city’s saloons. 
    By then <span id="liquor">liquor</span> sales
    had caused so much trouble and crime among Confederate soldiers and civilian 
    that many in <span class="location" id="Richmond">Richmond</span> welcomed martial law. 
    Winder also barred rail shipments of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> into the Confederate capital. 
    Apothecaries were allowed to dispense
    <span id="liquor">liquor</span> only with a doctor’s prescription.

    Martial law did not stop the distribution of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>, 
    but merely drove it underground. There were still countless cases of drunk and disorderly behavior, 
    as well as arrests for illegal sales of <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span>. 
    Corruption flourished among the provost
    guards, some of whom forged prescriptions for <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span>. 
    After obtaining the <span id="liquor">liquor</span>, they then arrested the apothecaries who 
    had dispensed it, thus adding insult to injury.

<h2>A ‘Creature Comfort’ Care Package From Home</h2>

<p>
    A great deal of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> was sent 
    to army camps on both sides by well-meaning relatives back home. 
    It was a common practice, especially among the Union soldiers, for 
    families to send their loved ones packages of fresh, canned, or smoked
    food and other small creature comforts. Commanding officers quickly realized 
    that a great deal of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> was also being smuggled into 
    camp inside these care packages. General <span id="BenjaminButler">Benjamin Butler</span> 
    later testified before <span id="Congress">Congress</span> that a search of an
    <span id="AdamsExpressCompany">Adams Express Company</span> depot yielded 150 
    different packages of <span id="liquor">liquor</span> in crates and boxes on their way to his command.

<p>
    Every parcel intended for a soldier had to be opened and inspected by officers of 
    his regiment or brigade. <span id="UnionPrivateBillings">Union Private John D. Billings</span>, 
    in his classic memoir <span id="HardtackCoffee">Hardtack and Coffee</span>, 
    recalled, “There was many a growl uttered by men who lost
    their little pint or quart bottle of some choice stimulating beverage, which had been 
    confiscated from a box as contraband of war.” <span id="Union Private John D. Billings">Billings</span> 
    noted some ingenious ways that innocent-looking gifts concealed <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>. 
    One favorite ruse was hiding
    a bottle of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> inside a well-roasted turkey. 
    <span id="whiskey">Whiskey</span> bottles also came into <span id="Union Private John D. Billings">Billings</span>’ 
    camp in tin cans of small cakes or in loaves of bread with holes cut in the bottom.

<p>
    Smuggling <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> in legitimate-looking containers with 
    false labels was a common practice. A helpful sutler showed <span id="Benjamin Butler">Butler</span> 
    several little bottles that supposedly contained hair oil packaged by a 
    <span class="location" id="NewYorkCity">New York City</span> firm. Instead, each bottle
    contained half a pint of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>, with a little olive oil on top.
    The bottles were sold wholesale at eight cents each, but soldiers paid 25 cents for them in camp. 
    The distributor claimed to have sold thousands of such bottles at <span class="location" id="FortMonroe">Fort Monroe</span>.

<h2><span id="alcohol">Alcohol</span> Restrictions Lead to Officer Impersonation</h2>

<p>
    In <span id="February1863">February 1863</span>, the <span id="UnionGuardBoatJacobBell">Union guard boat Jacob Bell</span> 
    searched the supply schooner Mail at <span class="location" id="Alexandria, Virginia">Alexandria, Virginia</span>. 
    Aboard the schooner were 428 dozen cans labeled “milk drink” packaged by 
    <span id="Numsen, Carroll & Company">Numsen, Carroll & Company</span>, 
    a <span class="location" id="Baltimore">Baltimore</span> firm. Upon
    closer inspection, <span id="LtMcCrea">Lt. Cmdr. E.P. McCrea</span> 
    learned that the milk drink was actually “villainous eggnog.” <span id="CommodoreHarwood">Commodore Andrew Harwood</span> 
    noted that the cans were not soldered in the usual way. The top and bottom had been heated with a resinous
    substance and the edges bent over so that the cover at either end could be 
    removed to convert the can into a drinking cup. Harwood issued orders to the <span id="PotomacFlotilla">Potomac Flotilla</span> 
    to seize any vessel caught smuggling <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span>.

    Sutlers were in a good position to profit from <span id="liquor">liquor</span> sales. 
    Regulations prohibited them from selling <span id="liquor">liquor</span> to enlisted personnel, 
    but many of the officially licensed merchants evaded the rules. Sutlers could openly stock 
    <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> because they
    were still allowed to sell it to officers. Brassy enlisted men frequently borrowed a 
    pair of officers’ shoulder straps and purchased <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> in the shops. 
    Others stole bottles from sutler huts, wagons, or tents.

<p>
    Impersonating an officer was only one of the many ways that Union and 
    Confederate soldiers managed to get around the rules restricting their drinking.
    Assignment to guard duty also provided opportunities for mischief. In eastern 
    <span class="location" id="NorthCarolina">North
    Carolina</span> in <span id="April1862">April 1862</span>, several men in the 
    <span id="51stPennsylvania">51st Pennsylvania</span> were ordered to guard the 
    commissary tent in which a newly arrived shipment of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> 
    barrels was stored. One night the guards took the barrels off their muskets. After
    unscrewing the breech plugs, each soldier had a long iron straw, which he inserted into 
    the bung-hole of a <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> cask and sucked himself into intoxication.

    Among the busiest routes for smuggling <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> to the 
    <span id="UnionArmy">Union Army</span> was the <span class="location" id="LongBridge">Long Bridge</span>, 
    which crossed the <span class="location" id="PotomacRiver">Potomac River</span>, linking <span class="location" id="Washington">Washington, D.C.</span>, 
    to <span class="location" id="Virginia">Virginia</span>. On <span id="23November1863">November 23, 1863</span>, 
    all contraband <span id="liquor">liquor</span> seized on the bridge was turned over to the 
    <span id="ArmyMedicalMuseum">Army Medical Museum</span>, located not far from the 
    <span class="location" id="Washington">Washington</span> end of the bridge. 
    At the time, tissue specimens saved for the museum were wrapped in cloth and preserved in a 
    keg of <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> or <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>. Each specimen was identified
    by a small wooden block, with a description written on it in pencil so that the <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> 
    would not dissolve the writing. Confiscated <span id="liquor">liquor</span> was distilled again 
    by the museum into uniform grade 70 percent <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span>, which was deemed perfect for
    preserving specimens.

<a href="#liquor">liquor</a>

<p>
    <span id="SurgeonBrinton">Surgeon John H. Brinton</span> recalled that ground around the 
    museum was piled high with “kegs, bottles, demijohns, and cases, to say nothing of an infinite variety 
    of tins, made so as to fit unperceived on the body, and thus permit the wearer to
    smuggle <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> into camp.” Another medical officer, 
    <span id="SurgeonWalsh">Acting Assistant Surgeon Ralph S.L. Walsh</span>, 
    marveled at the ingenuity of <span id="liquor">liquor</span> smugglers. Goods confiscated for the museum, 
    ranging from blackberry wine to straight alcohol, were packed
    in many peculiar vessels. Frequently women were arrested with belts under their skirts to which were 
    fastened tin cans holding between a quart and a gallon of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>. 
    In a number of cases the women sported false breasts, each holding a
    quart or more of contraband <span id="liquor">liquor</span>. Guards seized so much 
    <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> at <span class="location" id="LongBridge">Long Bridge</span> 
    during the war that the <span id="ArmyMedicalMuseum">Army Medical Museum</span> had enough

    In many camps sutlers were allowed to sell patent medicines. Often these remedies 
    were nothing more than <span id="liquor">liquor</span> flavored and tinted with herbal concoctions. 
    Countless posters and newspapers touted the healing power of bitters, <span id="liquor">liquor</span>
    strongly flavored with herbs. Some medicinal bitters were served as drinks in saloons. 
    The highly advertised <span id="DrakePlantationBitters">Drake’s Plantation Bitters</span>,

    Once, in the absence of the regiment’s sutler, it fell to <span id="LieutenantTownshend">Townshend</span> to order a shipment of necessities and

    to order several cases of <span id="HostetterBitters">Hostetter’s Bitters</span> to help soldiers who

    As <span id="LieutenantTownshend">Townshend</span> reported,

    <span id="BrigBlenker">Brig. Gen. Louis Blenker</span>, for one, ordered sutlers to

    Perhaps the most creative dodge was used by a soldier of the 
    <span id="11thOhio">11th Ohio</span>, who killed a snake and, in the words of a marveling comrade, 
    “carefully dissecting the varmint obtained a long, white cartilage, which he carefully cleaned and coiled up.
    Proceeding to the hospital, he politely requested a small quantity of <span id="spirit">spirits</span>
    in which to preserve the curiosity (which he represented as a tape worm). 
    The surgeon not only agreed, but complimented the man highly for the interest he

    adopted the British ration of half a pint of <span id="grog">grog</span> per day. 
    Before the <span id="War1812">War of 1812</span>, imported <span id="rum">rum</span> 
    from <span id="BritainCaribbeancolonies">Britain’s Caribbean colonies</span> was dropped in favor of American-made <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>. Despite
    the switch, sailors and the general public continued calling the naval ration <span id="grog">grog</span>. 
    On land, lower class saloons were called <span id="grog">grog</span>-shops or groggeries. 
    Aboard ship, the crew’s barrels of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> and the officers’ private stores 
    of <span id="liquor">liquors</span> and
    <span id="wine">wines</span> were kept locked up in the “<span id="spirit">spirit</span> room.” 
    At the captain’s discretion, extra rations of <span id="spirit">spirits</span>s were doled out 
    before and after action, or even during a battle. 
    During the long fight with <span id="CSSVirginia">CSS Virginia</span>, 
    the crew of <span id="USSMonitor">USS Monitor</span> was braced by
    a special issue of two ounces of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> per crewman.

<p>
    Captains also issued extra <span id="liquor">liquor</span> 
    as a reward for hard work such as the tedious and backbreaking job of loading coal aboard steam warships. 
    Confederate sailors outfitting <span id="SeaKing">Sea King</span>, which was secretly being converted at sea into <span id="CSSShenandoah">CSS Shenandoah</span>, received a serving of grog every two hours. 
    Mariners saw the <span id="spirit">spirit</span> ration as well-deserved compensation for 
    their long months of hard work and isolation at sea. With some reason, temperance advocates saw it instead as a
    severe problem and focused considerable effort on luring sailors away from the bottle. 
    In <span id="1832">1832</span> reformers persuaded <span id="Congress">Congress</span> 
    to cut the naval ration to one gill, or four ounces, daily. Sailors under the age of 21 and anyone who chose not to
    draw a <span id="spirit">spirit</span> ration received instead a small cash commutation, 
    which had risen to five cents a day by <span id="1861">1861</span>.

    <p>
    After reducing the naval <span id="grog">grog</span> ration, <span id="Congress">Congress</span> 
    debated but did not act further on the temperance movement’s demands for tighter restrictions. 
    A chance to end the <span id="grog">grog</span> ration arose again when Southern members of <span id="Congress">Congress</span> 
    left the nation’s
    capital after the beginning of the war. Northern representatives and senators were more sympathetic 
    to the temperance cause, and with Southern seats now vacant, there were enough Northern votes to abolish 
    the naval <span id="spirit">spirit</span> rations. A <span id="14July1862">July
    14, 1862</span>, act of <span id="Congress">Congress</span> set <span id="August31">August 31</span> 
    of that same year as the last day for the <span id="grog">grog</span> ration. A correspondent aboard 
    an unnamed vessel wrote to the <span id="PhiladelphiaPress">Philadelphia Press</span> that <span id="Congress">Congress</span> 
    had made a great mistake. He warned that ending the
    <span id="spirit">spirit</span> ration would drive all the old seamen out of the service. 
    Aboard the receiving ship <span class="location" id="NorthCarolina">North Carolina</span> in 
    <span class="location" id="NewYorkCity">New York City</span> harbor, 
    the men met the restriction with muttered growls, but no signs of incipient mutiny were readily apparent.

<h2>Kegs Auctioned Off & Turned In To Medical Staff</h2>

<p>
    <span id="spirit">Spirit</span> kegs remained under lock and key until naval vessels returned to port. About 3,000 kegs were auctioned off and others were turned over to the naval medical service for hospital use. Excess <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> in the 
    <span id="NorthAtlanticBlockadingSquadron">North Atlantic Blockading
    Squadron</span> was stored aboard the aptly named ship <span id="Brandywine">Brandywine</span>. As compensation for the loss of the <span id="spirit">spirit</span> ration, the <span id="Navy">Navy</span> added five cents per day to sailors’ pay, a raise of between 8 and 10 percent. Despite the banning of <span id="grog">grog</span>, there was still
    some <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> aboard Union naval vessels. “Distilled spirituous <span id="liquor">liquors”</span> were allowed on board ship as medical stores. And officers, trusted by <span id="Congress">Congress</span> more than common sailors, were still allowed to have private stores of <span id="liquor">liquors</span> and <span id="wine">wines</span>.

<p>
    <span id="grog">Grog</span> was served in the <span id="ConfederateNavy">Confederate Navy</span> as well. Rebel tars were entitled to one gill of <span id="spirit">spirits</span>s or half a pint of <span id="wine">wine</span> per day. As in the <span id="UnionNavy">Union Navy</span>, a small cash commutation was paid to sailors not taking their <span id="spirit">spirit</span> ration. <span id="ConfederateNavy">Confederate Navy</span> officials had considerable trouble obtaining enough spirituous <span id="liquor">liquor</span> for rations and hospital use. Naval requirements clashed with state regulations that reserved corn and grain for food rather than distillation of <span id="spirit">spirits</span>. Eventually a distillery was set up in <span class="location" id="Augusta">Augusta</span>, <span class="location" id="Georgia">Georgia</span>, to produce <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> for naval use. Despite the trouble in obtaining <span id="liquor">liquor</span>, the <span id="ConfederateNavy">Confederate Navy</span> never got around to banning its <span id="spirit">spirit</span> ration, and it remained on the books until the war ended in <span id="1865">1865</span>.

Sailors slipped into a coal bunker and bored through a thin bulkhead separating the coal from the <span id="spirit">spirit</span> room. Then they drilled a hole into the head of a barrel of <span id="liquor">liquor</span> and inserted a lead pipe. The pilfered <span id="grog">grog</span> was distributed among the crew, said
    <span id="MidshipmanMorgan">Morgan</span>, “and soon there was a battle royal going on the berth deck which the master-at-arms was unable to stop.” Georgia’s first lieutenant went below and induced most of the men to give themselves up for punishment. One holdout defied
    the officers, but <span id="MidshipmanMorgan">Morgan</span> tackled him and the master-at-arms handcuffed him. Several crewmen were placed in irons and sentenced to a spell in the brig on bread and water.

    Doctors at the time incorrectly believed that <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> was a stimulant, so they prescribed it to treat sick or wounded soldiers.

<h2>A Prized Commodity in Medical Treatment</h2>

<p>
    <span id="whiskey">Whiskey</span> or <span id="brandy">brandy</span>, either alone or mixed with other ingredients, were routinely used to treat patients suffering from wounds or illnesses. Usually <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> was prescribed in frequent but small doses, perhaps one ounce or one tablespoon every few hours. Sometimes it was administered by itself, but it might also be mixed in eggnog or milk punch. One example concerned the case of <span id="AugustusFalls">Private Augustus C. Falls</span> of the <span id="1stNewYorkHeavyArtillery">1st New York Heavy Artillery</span>. Falls was admitted to <span id="DouglasHospital">Douglas Hospital</span> in <span class="location" id="Washington">Washington</span> with diarrhea on <span id="5August1864">August 5, 1864</span>. A surgeon prescribed 11/2 ounces of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> each day at dinner. Three days later the dosage was raised to two ounces of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> three times a day. On <span id="29September">September 29</span>, the dosage was again
    increased to three ounces of <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> every four hours. Despite the special treatment, <span id="AugustusFalls">Falls</span> died on <span id="5October">October 5</span>.

    One of the few effective <span id="drug">drugs</span> of the era, <span id="quinine">quinine</span>, could prevent <span id="malaria">malaria</span> or ease symptoms for patients who already had the disease. Soldiers often balked at taking their <span id="malaria">malaria</span> medicine, though, because of its markedly bitter taste. To cajole soldiers into taking <span id="quinine">quinine</span>, some surgeons mixed it with <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>. This created the opposite problem; some soldiers enjoyed the <span id="quinine">quinine</span>-<span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> dose so much that they sneaked through the line for a second prescription. While stationed at <span class="location" id="NewBern_NorthCarolina">New Bern, North Carolina</span>, the men of the <span id="44thMassachusetts">44th Massachusetts</span> found that their medical officers took precautions to limit the soldiers to one dose each. Instead of serving <span id="quinine">quinine</span> in <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>, the <span id="drug">drug</span> came blended with medical <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span>, water, and cayenne pepper. “No soldier,” wrote a veteran of the regiment, “is known to have acquired a dangerous hankering for the mixture.”

<h2>Guilty on Charges of Drunkenness</h2>

    Southern medical officers struggled to obtain sufficient quantities of medicinal <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span>. <span id="GeneralSamuelMoore">Surgeon General Samuel P.

    Drunkenness could be overlooked if it occurred when a soldier was off duty and did not compound his offense with other crimes. Court-martial of officers charged with drunkenness was handled differently from those of enlisted men. Officers found guilty could be cashiered with forfeiture of pay. In addition to dismissal, a Confederate law of <span id="1862">1862</span> allowed a public reprimand of officers convicted of drunkenness. An officer dismissed from the Confederate service could also be
    conscripted back into the ranks as an enlisted man. Enlisted personnel found guilty of drunkenness usually faced some form of confinement, corporal punishment, or public shaming. Penalties varied depending on the degree of the soldier’s offense and the policies of his commanding officer. Common punishments for drunken enlisted men included confinement in a guard tent or guardhouse, wearing a barrel with a placard noting that the culprit was a drunk, extra duty, or a spell carrying a log or marching with a knapsack filled with rocks.

<p>
    A serious instance of generals drinking on duty contributed to the Union defeat at the <span id="BattleCrater">Battle of the Crater</span> on <span id="30July1864">July 30, 1864</span>. After successfully detonating a huge explosion in a tunnel dug under the Confederate lines outside <span class="location" id="Petersburg">Petersburg</span>, Union     forces moved in to exploit the break in the Rebel defenses. <span id="JamesLedlie">Brig.

    On <span id="21October1863">October 21, 1863</span>, the <span id="CharlestonCourier">Charleston Courier</span> published a recipe for persimmon <span id="brandy">brandy</span>.

In thrifty fashion, the writer suggested saving the persimmon seeds.

<h2>For Some, Private Distilling Filled the Gap</h2>

<p>
    Plagued with food shortages, inflation, and transportation problems, Southern soldiers and civilians dealt with severe shortages of <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> caused by state legislatures restricting the use of grain, corn and foodstuffs for distilled <span id="liquor">liquor</span>. Private distilling took a blow after the Federal capture of <span class="location" id="Chattanooga">Chattanooga</span> in <span id="September1863">September 1863</span> and advancing Union forces captured copper mines desperately needed by the South. Not only did their loss crimp production of brass artillery pieces, it also threatened the manufacture of percussion caps and artillery friction primers. The <span id="ConfederateOrdnanceBureau">Confederate Ordnance Bureau</span> confiscated scores of copper <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span> stills in western <span class="location" id="NorthCarolina">North Carolina</span>. Metal from the stills went into many of the South’s
    percussion caps made during the remainder of the war.

<h2>Persimmon Brandy & Other Homemade Recipes</h2>

    Southern blockade runners brought <span id="wine">wine</span>, <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>, <span id="brandy">brandy</span> and other potables from <span class="location" id="Europe">Europe</span>. Less popular than <span id="wine">wine</span> and <span id="brandy">brandy</span>, but still showing up in blockade runner holds, were <span id="rum">rum</span>, <span id="gin">gin</span>, <span id="ScotchWhisky">Scotch whisky</span>, <span id="champagne">champagne</span>, <span id="ale">ale</span>, <span id="porter">porter</span>, and
    <span id="schnapps">schnapps</span>. Occasionally one might even find imported cut glass decanters to serve the imported <span id="liquor">liquors</span>. Pure <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span>, intended as medical supplies, also passed through the blockade. Blockade-run <span id="liquor">liquor</span> was beyond the financial means of most Confederates, forcing many people to turn to home-made substitutes. Despite wartime laws, some corn and grain found their way into <span id="whiskey">whiskey</span>. When these standard ingredients were not available, distillers turned to sweet potatoes, rice,
    sorghum seeds, and persimmons.
