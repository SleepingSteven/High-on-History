<h1>Creating Supermen: battlefieldperformance enhancing drugs</h1>

<p><span id="LanceArmstrong">Lance Armstrong</span>'s doping scandal blew the lid on performance enhancing drugs in professional sport, but opened up the debate regarding their use inother walks of life. Given what's at stake, should soldiers be pumped full ofdrugs to help them reach their peak, and to what extent is this alreadyhappening?</p>
<p>With his admission to what was dubbed as sport’smost widespread doping regime in history, LanceArmstrong unwittingly blew the lid on the greatlengths athletes will go to in order to gain anadvantage over their opponents. Pumped full of <span id="EPO">EPO</span> and oxygen-infused blood, Armstrong left othercyclists in his wake as he cruised to seven <span id="TourFrance">Tour de France</span> titles.</p>
<p>While using performance enhancing drugs to gain anunfair advantage over rivals considered to becompeting clean obviously defeats the object of thecontest, the presence of such substances opens thecurious debate regarding their validity outside of thesporting world. Surgeons, requiring a cool head and asteady hand, have long been known to usemedications designed to steady nerves. If this potentially saves lives, then surely the use of these medications is warranted?</p>
<p>If this is indeed the case, then how far does this extend into the unique circumstances associated with military action? War fighters are generallytasked with protecting a perceived greater good, andtheir success or failure can significantly impact thelives of innocent civilians. With so much at stake,could it even be argued that soldiers cannot affordnot to dope?</p>

<h3>Pilots on ‘Go Pills’</h3>

<h3>“US pilots became involved in a friendly fireincident over <span class="location" id="Tarnak Farms">Tarnak Farms</span>, <span class="location" id="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</span>, whileunder the influence of <span id="Dexedrine">Dexedrine</span>.”</h3>

<p>US Air Force pilots’ use of amphetamines is one ofthe most widely documented examples of the use of performance enhancing drugs by military personnel. Often tasked with conducting excessively longmissions – some lasting upwards of 20 hours – US Department of Defense scientists began to issue dextroamphetamines – more commonly known as <span id="Speed">‘Speed’</span>, but referred to as ‘Go Pills’ within the USAF – to its pilots to ensure they remained alert long after tiredness and fatigue should have started to impingeon mental performance.</p>
<p>Although the benefits of such drugs have been rendered ideal, the side effects, including confusion, delusions, auditory hallucinations, aggression and, inextreme cases, psychotic behaviour, represent adisposition that is hardly ideal for a person in charge of a multimillion-dollar war machine. This is best evidenced by an incident in <span id="April2002">April 2002</span>, in which US pilots became involved in a friendly fire incident over <span class="location" id="TarnakFarms">Tarnak Farms</span>, <span class="location" id="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</span>, while under the influence of <span id="Dexedrine">Dexedrine</span>. Four Canadian soldiers died in the accident.</p>
<p>The air force does not hide away from the use of such <span id="Amphetamines">amphetamines</span>, and has publicly disclosed the prescription of small doses – often 10mg – of <span id="Dexedrine">Dexedrine</span> if “fatigue could be expected to degrade air crew performance.” While the <span id="USAF">USAF</span> is quick to insist that the use of such medications is voluntary and consent forms must be signed by pilots, the formalso notes that pilots can be grounded if they decline. Pilot groundings, no matter the circumstances, canhave serious implications on a pilot’s career,potentially leading to a perverse situation where a pilot could almost feel forced to take the drugs.</p>

<h3>Banned by <span id="WADA">WADA</span>, sought by the army</h3>

<p>The US Army sought to follow the <span id="USAF">USAF</span>’s lead regarding the use of performance enhancing drugs by investigating <span id="Dimethylamine">Dimethylamine (DMAA)</span>, aperformance enhancing supplement registered onthe <span id="WorldAnti-DopingAgency">World Anti-Doping Agency</span>’s banned substance list. Investigations were under way until the supplement was pulled from the shelves, having been linked with the deaths of two soldiers in <span id="December2011">December 2011</span> while undergoing a routine training drill.</p>
<p>Supplements containing <span id="Dimethylamine">DMAA</span> grew in popularitydue to their premise of increasing stamina and performance, particularly in preparation for gruelling physical challenges. The drug captured headlines inthe <span class="location" id="UK">UK</span> after it was linked to the death of 30-year old <span id="ClaireSquires">Claire Squires</span>, who died of cardiac failure having run 25 miles of the 26.2 mile <span id="LondonMarathon">London Marathon</span> course. The <span id="USArmy">US Army</span> continues to dispute the drug’s links to the death of the soldiers, perhaps alarmingly citing that “the use and safety of these stimulant productsremains matters of intense interest to theDepartment of Defense.</p>

<h3>”Peak Soldier Performance Programme</h3>

<p>The comments regarding the US <span id="DoD">DoD</span>’s interest in stimulants harks back to <span id="DARPA">DARPA</span>’s <span id="PeakSoldierPerformanceProgramme">Peak Soldier Performance Programme</span>, which in <span id="2004">2004</span> sought a biochemical approach that would allow a soldier to operate in theatre for up to five days without requiring sustenance. In pursuit of this, no stone or genome was left unturned.</p>

<h3>“The air force does not hide away from the useof such amphetamines, and has publicly disclosed the prescription of small doses.</h3>

<p>”<span id="DARPA">DARPA</span>’s approach included investigations into endurance-building nutrients that could be taken in the lead-up to deployment, while also lowering a soldier’s core temperature and boosting his or hermitochondria. Mitochondria are effectively a cell’spower supply, fuelling it by converting sugars into chemical energy. <span id="OxfordUniversity">Oxford University</span> biochemists sought ways in which mitochondria could be altered genetically to have them feed off fat-based ketones, leading to much smaller, ketone-based rations being capable of not only keeping soldiers on their feet, buthaving them operate at their peak for days at a time. Initial laboratory tests demonstrated that rats given the treatment were able to run for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>Other approaches include altering a soldier’s metabolism to reduce the need to feed, lowering body temperatures during strenuous activities, sothat less energy was exerted, and even caffeinated gum, which would provide a quick energy boost intimes of dire need, was experimented with. The idea,as one <span id="DARPA">DARPA</span> official informed <span id="Wired">Wired</span>, was not to create <span id="Supermen">Supermen</span>, but to make it so that “these kids could perform at their peak, stay at their peak, andcome home to their families.</p>

<h3>”An ethical dilemma“</h3>

<h3>The report alluded to the potential development of drugs that could suppress thefear and inhibition of soldiers.</h3>

<p>”The notion of creating <span id="Supermen">Supermen</span> poses an obvious ethical dilemma, and the office of US President <span id="GeorgeBush">George W. Bush</span> responded by issuing the <span id="2003">2003</span> report ‘Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness’, which referenced issues concerned with the use of performance enhancing drugs and treatments.</p>
<p>The report alluded to discussions regarding memory-blunting drugs that could be issued to soldiers to prevent mental scarring or occurrences of <span id="PTSD">Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</span> after combat operations, providing they demonstrated efficacy intesting, but focused upon the unique circumstancesof war, rubbishing any comparison to pursuits where <span id="PED">PED</span>s are outlawed, such as professional sports.</p>
<p>“What guidance, if any, does our analysis provide for such moments of extreme peril and consequence...when superior performance is a matter of life and death?” the report asked, adding: “There may indeed be times when we must override certain limits or prohibitions that make sense in other contexts.</p>
<p>”Sections of the report continued in the same vein, confirming attitudes shared by US decision makers that in the grand scheme of ethics, the demands of war may transcend what would otherwise be commonly acceptable. “When we override our own boundaries, we do so or should do so for the sake ofthe whole, and only when the whole itself is at stake, when everything human and humanly dignified maybe lost.</p>

<h3>”Men remaining human</h3>

<p>The report did, however, insist that physical advancements owing to drugs must only go so far, even in extreme circumstances, emphasising great importance on the notion of “men remaining human even in moments of great crisis.” The report alluded to the potential development of drugs that could suppress the fear and inhibition of soldiers, effectively turning them into killing machines capable of acting without both scrutiny andimpunity.</p>
<p>Given the clamour from agencies including the <span id="USArmy">US Army</span>, <span id="USAirForce">US Air Force</span> and <span id="DARPA">DARPA</span> to instigate research into and the explicit use of pharmaceuticals capable of enhancing performance, it must be considered a matter of when, rather than if soldiers are issued with such drugs. A new age arms race could soon be launched, with the limits of human capabilities, rather than human intelligence and ingenuity, the new battleground.</p>
<p>Budget cuts and financial implications haverestricted the number of active, retained servicemen, so it is perhaps a predictable practice to ensure that these remaining soldiers are given every possible advantage to ensure national security. With reports issued by the US purposefully vague as to what is deemed an acceptable limit however, it remains to beseen just how advanced soldiers could become.</p>
