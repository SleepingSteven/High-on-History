    <h2>Drugs, alcohol, and the First World War</h2>
    <p>The plethora of comment and reflection on the <span id="First World War">First World
        War</span> has overlooked the importance of that war for <span id="drug">drug</span> and
        <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> control. Yet this war was crucial in the establishment
        of a system of international control for <span id="drug">drugs</span> that still
        endures today. It instituted models of control for <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> that
        also had a lengthy life. In 2014, the First World War is still a
        potent presence so far as drugs and <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> are concerned.
        International <span id="drug">drug</span> control had been discussed before the
        war, but a global system was unlikely. The major initiative
        had come from the Americans in the <span id="early 1900s">early 1900s</span>, driven by
        twin motives of moral regulation and strategic advantage
        in the <span id="Far East">Far East</span>. The Americans believed that “civilising” and
        converting the <span id="Chinese">Chinese</span> would come through the ending of
        their <span id="opium">opium</span> consumption. Missionaries and the <span id="US State
        Department">US State Department</span> had trained their sights on the <span id="Indo-Chinese opium trade">Indo-Chinese opium trade</span>, a trade which civil servants in the <span id="British
        Foreign Office">British Foreign Office</span> were already bringing to a close. The <span id="Shanghai
        Convention">Shanghai Convention</span> of <span id="1909">1909</span> retained a Far Eastern focus, but
        afterwards the compass of potential control widened. There
        was genuine concern in the <span id="British Foreign Office">British Foreign Office</span> about
        <span id="morphine">morphine</span> and <span id="cocaine">cocaine</span> smuggling in southeast <span id="Asia">Asia</span> and this topic was taken up by the Americans as an important part of
        the international control agenda. The <span id="Hague Convention">Hague Convention</span> of <span id="1912">1912</span> was the product of this expanded geographical concern. The decision at the <span id="Hague Convention">Hague</span> that <span id="opium">opium</span>, <span id="morphine">morphine</span>, and <span id="cocaine">cocaine</span> and their use should be confi ned to “legitimate medical purposes” was central to future international <span id="drug">drug</span> control. Earlier enquiries, such
        as the <span id="Indian Royal Commission on Opium">Indian Royal Commission on Opium</span> of <span id="1895">1895</span>, had defended medical and non-medical use, and indeed had taken the view that it was difficult to distinguish one type of use from the other. But there were further complications about extending control. The <span id="German Government">German Government</span> refused to adhere to the <span id="Hague Convention">Convention</span> because it might be only partially applied and therefore damage the German <span id="cocaine">cocaine</span> industry; it insisted that all 34 participating powers had to ratify the <span id="Hague Convention">Hague Convention</span> before it could come into force.
        The convention thus had an “all or nothing” aspect that had not been initially intended. As the <span id="British Delegates">British Delegates</span> wrote in their Report, “It [the convention] has, for the first time, laid down as a principle of international morality that the various countries concerned cannot stand alone in these measures.” The German proviso was a delaying tactic and so only those countries committed to further controls went ahead before the outbreak of war. The <span id="USA">USA</span> was one, keen to take a prohibitionist stance. The <span id="US Harrison Act">US Harrison Act</span> of <span id="1914">1914</span>, a revenue measure, aimed to restrict access to <span id="drug">drugs</span> and to
        “stamp out” addiction. Other countries were less keen and by the outbreak of the <span id="First World War">First World War</span>, there had been only eight ratifications. In the <span id="UK">UK</span>, rather desultory discussions before the war envisaged simply an extension of existing pharmacy controls and possibly some further restrictions on the dispensing of doctors’ prescriptions. The <span id="First World War">war</span> changed the situation. In the <span id="UK">UK</span>, it brought the <span id="Home Office">Home Office</span> in <span id="2014">2014</span> still the lead department for drug policy—into a central role and also more stringent restriction onto the agenda. Two issues caused concern. Smuggling of <span id="drug">drugs</span> showed that controls were indeed interdependent at the international level. The <span id="UK">UK</span> was the world’s major manufacturer of <span id="morphine">morphine</span> and the exported <span id="drug">drug</span> was being diverted into <span id="China">China</span> via <span id="Japan">Japan</span>. The <span id="Home Office">Home Office</span> introduced a system of import/export certification designed to ensure that all shipments out of the country had a legitimate destination. <span id="morphine">Morphine</span> was the main smuggled <span id="drug">drug</span> but the use of <span id="cocaine">cocaine</span> also seemed to be expanding in some of the combatant countries. It was feared that army effi ciency was at risk. In the <span id="UK">UK</span>, the <span id="drug-scare">“drug scare”</span> first arose in <span id="Folkestone">Folkestone</span> with sales to Canadian soldiers billeted there. Then the <span id="West End">West End</span> of <span id="London">London</span> became the focus; there were fears that sex workers and others were selling <span id="drug">drugs</span> to soldiers. Pharmacy laws were powerless to stop the trade despite some attempts at prosecution. <span id="The Daily Chronicle">The Daily Chronicle</span> expressed the fears of the time. ‘It <span id="cocaine">[cocaine]</span> is driving hundreds of women mad. What is worse, it will drive, unless the traffic in it is checked,
        hundreds of soldiers mad.” The <span id="UK Government">UK Government</span> passed emergency restrictions under the <span id="Defence of the Realm Act">Defence of the Realm Act</span> in <span id="1916">1916</span>, regulation 40B, which tightened domestic controls. It made non-medical possession an offence and required a doctor’s prescription for <span id="cocaine">cocaine</span>. <span id="Germany">Germany</span>, <span id="Canada">Canada</span>, and other countries brought in similar controls during the war.</p>
    <h2>Perspectives</h2>
    <p>A later enquiry concluded that there was, in fact, very little recreational <span id="cocaine">cocaine</span> use apart from the small <span id="West End">West End</span> “scene”, but by then restriction had taken on a life of its own. <span id="Article 295">Article 295</span> of the peace settlement enacted through the <span id="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</span> in <span id="1919">1919</span> brought the <span id="Hague Convention">Hague Convention</span> into operation and gave the newly established <span id="League of Nations">League of Nations</span> general supervision over international narcotics agreements. At the <span id="first League Assembly">first League Assembly</span>, an <span id="Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium and other Dangerous Drugs">Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium and other Dangerous Drugs</span> was created, its initial members the European countries with colonial <span id="opium">opium</span> monopolies. The <span id="First World War">war</span> had swept away prewar difficulties about ratification and brought worldwide control. By the <span id="mid-1920s">mid-1920s</span> international drug control had become what the US historian <span id="William McAllister">William McAllister</span> calls a “going concern”. A full control machinery covered manufacture, trade in, and distribution of addictive substances, with an import/export certificate system based on the British model. <span id="cannabis">Cannabis</span> was brought into the system in the <span id="1920s">1920s</span>. <span id="alcohol">Alcohol</span> control, like <span id="opium">opium</span>, was also a matter of international concern before the <span id="First World War">war</span>. But the <span id="First World War">war</span> did not lead to a similar international convention, only a regional system which covered colonies in <span id="Africa">Africa</span>. <span id="First World War">War</span> nevertheless had a longstanding impact at the national level. British and American forms of control were different. In the <span id="UK">UK</span>, concerns about the impact of <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> on the <span id="First World War">war</span> effort brought central state regulation. The drink issue was adroitly used by <span id="Lloyd George">Lloyd George</span> as <span id="Minister of Munitions">Minister of Munitions</span> and at one stage he considered wholesale state purchase of the drink trade. Drink nationalisation was not practical politics and instead a <span id="CCB">Central Control Board (CCB)</span> was set up in <span id="1915">1915</span>. It was given wide powers to regulate and even to purchase the trade in key military and naval areas and its overall powers extended to the whole country by <span id="1916">1916</span>. The <span id="CCB">CCB</span> limited the hours of consumption and introduced the famous <span id="afternoon gap">“afternoon gap”</span>, when pubs and clubs had to close. “Off” sales of spirits were prohibited in the evenings and at weekends and their strength was reduced. Servicemen had been plied with drinks in pubs so “treating” (buying rounds) was forbidden. The <span id="CCB">CCB</span>, chaired by <span id="Viscount D’Abernon">Viscount D’Abernon</span>, had a research committee and was concerned to base its actions on scientific evidence. State control of the trade was introduced in certain key military areas <span id="Enfield Lock">Enfield Lock</span> near <span id="London">London</span>, and the <span id="Carlisle">Carlisle</span> area. Industrial canteens were established. The <span id="CCB">CCB</span> even set up its own pubs and the war thus brought the introduction of a system which had been widely discussed before war—<span id="disinterested management”—pubs"> ”disinterested management”—pubs</span> run not for a profit, under state control. Statistics showed that such policies, which were widely accepted by the public, had an impact on measures of harm from <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span>, such as deaths from <span id="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</span> of the liver and arrests for drunkenness. By the early <span id="1920s">1920s</span> per capita        spirit consumption in the <span id="UK">UK</span> had halved from its prewar level and beer consumption also declined. Convictions        for drunkenness fell from more than 130 000 to just over 29 000 per year. Unlike <span id="drug control">drug control</span>, this overall system of <span id="alcohol control">alcohol control</span> did not persist into the postwar years. Central control was abandoned, although some elements of the war time system remained in existence. In the <span id="USA">USA</span>, by contrast, war time restrictions led to national prohibition enacted in <span id="1920">1920</span>. That system lasted only until <span id="1929">1929</span>, but like war time controls in the <span id="UK">UK</span> it affected patterns of drinking with a move towards spirit drinking and a decline in <span id="beer">beer</span> consumption. It came to an end not because prohibition “failed” but because industrial and business interests, which had once supported it, removed their support as the <span id="Great Depression">Great Depression</span> took hold. <span id="Prohibition">Prohibition</span> in the <span id="USA">USA</span> was the best known of efforts by a number of countries to introduce similar systems. <span id="Iceland">Iceland</span> and <span id="Finland">Finland</span> had already brought in prohibition; <span id="Canada">Canada</span> and <span id="Norway">Norway</span> had partial prohibition. <span id="Russia">Russia</span> established prohibition during the war while <span id="Sweden">Sweden</span> voted in favour but never actually put it into practice. Further attempts to take controls through the <span id="League of Nations">League of Nations</span> fell foul of the French, representing the interests of the <span id="French wine industry">French wine industry</span>. There was what <span id="Mark Schrad">Mark Schrad</span> has called a <span id="global prohibition wave">“global prohibition wave”</span> drawing on prewar temperance interests and catalysed by the war effort. But these attempts ultimately failed. For <span id="drug">drugs</span>, a system with its origin in the needs of the colonial powers was later to be dominated by the <span id="USA">USA</span>. The system in the <span id="First World War">First World War</span> morphed into the <span id="United Nations">United Nations</span> control machinery after the <span id="Second World War">Second World War</span>, where it still remains today. Now former colonial countries in <span id="South America">South America</span> are testing the boundaries of the system in order to accommodate the culturally sanctioned use of <span id="drug">drugs</span> such as <span id="cocaine">coca</span>. But it would be premature to hail the demise of the <span id="First World War">Great War</span> system. The <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> restrictions also cast a lengthy shadow—state control lasted in <span id="Carlisle">Carlisle</span> until the early <span id="1970s">1970s</span> and the afternoon gap until <span id="1987">1987</span>. Now the <span id="UK Government">UK Government</span>’s <span id="Public Health Responsibility Deal">Public Health Responsibility Deal</span> is taking on some of the same issues, for example, reduction of the strength of <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span>. That deal has controversially brought industry and some public health interests together in a way also prefigured by the <span id="CCB">CCB</span>, which had industry and temperance members, although their alliance did not outlive the war. The war time restrictions on <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> still stand as an example of what government regulation can achieve in improving health and reducing crime. For both <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> and <span id="drug">drugs</span>, the <span id="First World War">First World War</span> was an external shock, initiating systems and developments that might never otherwise have come about.</p>
