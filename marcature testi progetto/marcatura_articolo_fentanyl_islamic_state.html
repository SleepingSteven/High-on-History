    <title>The Drugs of War—Captagon and the Islamic State</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>One perennial challenge of writing about illicit <span id="narcotics">narcotics</span> is the dearth of hard data. While drug-trafficking organizations often maintain scrupulous records of their transactions, they have a pronounced disincentive to open these books to outsiders. And for a variety of reasons, the media, the counterdrug law-enforcement establishment, and elected political leaders all have incentives to overplay the problem.</p>

<p>In a dismayingly typical scenario, drug warriors will fill this information vacuum by conjuring up back-of-the-envelope figures, which the press will then gleefully repeat—at which point, the drug warriors will seek a budget increase, citing the press account, which has now accorded their data points the aura of established fact. (This configuration of mutually affirming incentives is sometimes described—by federal bureaucrats who are clear-eyed enough to admit it—as a self-licking ice cream cone.)</p>

<p>If there is fog in the drug war, there is more still in the actual armed conflagration that has consumed <span id="Syria">Syria</span>, which is now entering its fifth year. And the violent fluidity of this conflict makes it all the more difficult to assess a wave of reports over the past several years about the significance of a little pill known as <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span>—an <span id="amphetamine">amphetamine</span> that is said to play a significant part in the <span id="civil war">civil war</span>.</p>

<h2>According to numerous accounts, <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> has become immensely popular with the fighters of the Islamic State.</h2>
<p>According to numerous accounts, <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> has become immensely popular with the fighters of the <span id="Islamic State">Islamic State</span>. The <span id="Washington Post"><i>Washington Post</i></span> says <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> is “fueling <span id="Syria">Syria</span>’s war and turning fighters into superhuman soldiers.”1 According to other reports, the gunmen in the terrorist attack on <span id="Paris">Paris</span> last <span id="November">November</span> had used the pills, which might explain what some observers described as their relentless, “zombie-like” focus during the assault.2 A series of alarming news stories have described the drug as a form of “chemical courage,”3 instilling those who take it with incredible strength and endurance, and the coldly robotic, fearless detachment that allows them to engage in a murderous rampage.</p>

<p>So far, so terrifying. But these stories are, to at least some degree, at odds with what we actually know about the <span id="drug">drug</span>. To begin with, the very name <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> is something of a misnomer: there was an <span id="amphetamine">amphetamine</span> that was commercially manufactured under that name until the <span id="1980s">1980s</span>, when it was banned on the grounds that it was too addictive. The <span id="drug">drug</span> is no longer manufactured under license, but it is still very widely produced, and variants of it can contain <span id="amphetamine">amphetamine</span> and <span id="caffeine">caffeine</span>, and sometimes also—reportedly—<span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> and <span id="ephedrine">ephedrine</span>.4 Like any <span id="amphetamine">amphetamine</span>, <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> boosts your energy and can increase your focus and help you to stay awake for long periods of time. It can also create a feeling of euphoria.</p>

<p>“The brigade leader came and told us, ‘This pill gives you energy. Try it,’” one former fighter told the <span id="BBC">BBC</span>. “So we took it the first time. You feel physically fit. And if there were ten people in front of you, you could catch them and kill them. You’re awake all the time. You don’t have any problems. You don’t even think about sleeping. You don’t think to leave the checkpoint. It gives you great courage and power.”5 One former veteran of the Syrian war tells <span id="New York Magazine"><i>New York Magazine</i></span>: “Some people take so much, if you shoot them, they won’t drop.”6</p>

<p>What is curious about these reports is that, in terms of its chemical composition, <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> does not appear to be able to deliver these superhuman properties. Rather, it resembles other <span id="amphetamines">amphetamines</span>s that are widely used by American college kids with attention <span id="ADHD">deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</span>. It is considerably weaker, in fact, than a drug like <span id="Adderall">Adderall</span>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, according to <span id="France 24"><i>France 24</i></span>, the reports about the <span id="Paris attackers">Paris attackers</span> using <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> proved to be erroneous.7 A toxicology report demonstrated that none of the participants in the attacks were drugged. (The report found faint traces of <span id="cannabis">cannabis</span> and <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> in the blood of two of the attackers, but the amounts were small enough that they would likely not have been ingested on the day of the attack.)</p>

<p>So how do we explain these reports? Is this an instance in which a sensationalist press is quick to recycle hysterical stories with no basis in reality? One interesting possible answer comes from <span id="Carl Hart">Carl Hart</span>, a professor of psychiatry at <span id="Columbia">Columbia</span> who is an expert on <span id="drug abuse">drug abuse</span>. In reconciling the relatively weak chemical properties of the drug with the outsized claims made by those who have taken it, <span id="Carl Hart">Hart</span> says, “The people who think they’re feeling this way must have been told they’re taking <span id="Superman pills">Superman pills</span>. So there could be a <span id="placebo effect">placebo effect</span> going on.”8</p>

<p>This would make sense: militaries around the world have supplied their soldiers with various chemical stimulants. The <span id="Nazis">Nazis</span> distributed millions of <span id="amphetamine">amphetamine</span> pills during <span id="World War II">World War II</span>.9 The <span id="U.S. Air Force">U.S. Air Force</span> still provides so-called <span id="go pills">“go pills”</span> to pilots so that they can remain awake on long flights. (These pills are generally <span id="Dexedrine">Dexedrine</span>.)10 A number of observers have pointed out that if <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> did, in fact, endow the user with superhuman strength, the <span id="U.S. Military">U.S. military</span> would no doubt be dispensing the pills to its own special operators. But even if <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> simply provides energy and greater focus, there would be good reason for <span id="Islamic State">Islamic State</span> fighters to take it—and if the myth that the <span id="drug">drug</span> makes you invincible takes hold, so much the better for them. If the <span id="placebo">placebo</span> effect has the power to activate the <span id="brain inner pharmacy">“brain’s inner pharmacy,”</span>11 then <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> may end up providing courage, after all.</p>

<p>But there’s another interesting aspect to this theory: it’s not only the brigade leader who has an incentive to overplay the effects of the <span id="drug">drug</span>, but the manufacturer, as well. A man who produces <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> at a factory in <span id="Lebanon">Lebanon</span>’s <span id="Bekaa Valley">Bekaa Valley</span> and sells it to <span id="ISIL">ISIL</span> fighters told <span id="New York Magazine"><i>New York</i></span>, “If you shoot someone on <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span>, they don’t feel it. And if someone takes many pills, like 30 or so, they become violent and crazy, paranoid, unafraid of anything.”12 If militants in <span id="Syria">Syria</span> are indeed taking thirty pills at a time, they may well be experiencing unintended side-effects, but <i>of course</i> the manufacturer would be overselling the product (not to mention suggesting a colossal dosage). Informed that doctors doubt <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span>’s ability to produce the effects he is describing, the manufacturer responds, “Doctors are stupid. They don’t know anything.” He adds, “<span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> is driving the entire war.”13</p>
<h2><span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> may not make you superhuman, but it is highly addictive. And it has long been a wildly popular drug in the <span id="Middle East">Middle East</span>.</h2>
<p><i>Is</i> the manufacture and sale of <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> driving the war? <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> may not make you superhuman, but it is highly addictive. And it has long been a wildly popular drug in the <span id="Middle East">Middle East</span>. In <span id="2014">2014</span>, the <span id="UNDOC">United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNDOC)</span> reported that half of all <span id="amphetamine">amphetamine</span> seizures worldwide were in the <span id="Middle East">Middle East</span>. Last year, a Saudi prince, <span id="Abdel Mohsen Bin Walid Bin Abdulaziz">Abdel Mohsen Bin Walid Bin Abdulaziz</span>, was arrested in <span id="Beirut">Beirut</span> as he tried to smuggle forty suitcases of <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> into <span id="Riyadh">Riyadh</span> on a private jet.14 Every year, tens of millions of <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> pills are seized in <span id="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</span> alone. Prior to the <span id="civil war">civil war</span>, <span id="Syria">Syria</span> had a significant pharmaceutical industry that supplied the region, and there is evidence that since the advent of the war, there has been an increase in production of <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> inside <span id="Syria">Syria</span>. According to the <span id="Guardian"><i>Guardian</i></span>, production of the drug in the <span id="Bekaa Valley">Bekaa valley</span> fell 90 percent between <span id="2011">2011</span> and <span id="2013">2013</span>, “with the decline largely attributed to production inside <span id="Syria">Syria</span>.”15</p>

<p>If the armies of the <span id="Islamic State">Islamic State</span> are using the <span id="drug">drug</span>, this would explain the uptick in production inside <span id="Syria">Syria</span>, but it’s also important to remember the entrepreneurial tendencies of this group. <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> sells for $10 or more per pill,16 and if some recent seizures are any indication—such as the 17 million pills confiscated by <span id="Dubai police">Dubai police</span> in <span id="2014">2014</span> 17—the drug is a big business. Fighters on all sides of the <span id="Syrian conflict">Syrian conflict</span> are reportedly using <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span>, and warlords benefit from the illicit trade in the drug—whether in spheres controlled by the government, the <span id="Free Syrian Army">Free Syrian Army</span>, or <span id="Islamists">Islamists</span>. <span id="ISIL">ISIL</span> has demonstrated its willingness to sell oil and loot antiquities, there is no reason to believe that the group would not make a lucrative business of selling drugs. The drug is so addictive, a former Free Syrian Army fighter told the <span id="BBC">BBC</span>, that combatants in Syria “would stop providing food for their children so they [could] buy <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span>.”18 In the ruthless calculus of the drug business, that’s a great product. According to the <span id="UNDOC">UNODC</span>, it is now being increasingly manufactured in <span id="Syria">Syria</span> and trafficked through the <span id="Middle East">Middle East</span>.19 As <span id="Masood Karimipour">Masood Karimipour</span> of the <span id="UNDOC">UNODC</span> told <span id="The Times"><i>The Times</i></span>: “If you’re in organized crime, <span id="civil war">civil war</span> is good for business.”20</p>

<p>It may be, in the end, that the superman qualities of <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> are a red herring—a mere <span id="placebo effect">placebo effect</span>, or a mantra for soldiers on the battlefield. But the properties of <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> as an addictive drug—one that could potentially generate tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year for <span id="ISIL">ISIL</span>—are much more significant, and this is an issue in which much more research is needed. Those funds could be used to purchase weapons, to finance attacks, and to perpetuate the conflict. In that respect, <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> may be driving the war after all.</p>
