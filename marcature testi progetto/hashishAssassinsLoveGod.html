    <h1>Hashish, Assassins, and the Love of God</h1>
    <h4>By Jerry Mandel</h4>
    
<p>"When I was in Russia I did not see any Secret Police," said Ameri-
    can Communist leader Earl Browder in a 1940's debate with Socialist
    Max Schachtman. "That," said Schachtman, "is the thing about Secret
    Police. They are secret."</p>   

<p>Once anything is made secret or driven underground, statistics and
    other evidence on the subject are hard to find and often distorted. The
    case for making <span id="marijuana">marijuana</span> illegal, culminating in the 1937 Federal 
    <span id="marijuana">Marijuana</span> Tax Act and the passage of Uniform State Narcotic Arts in most
    states between 1934-1937, was based on almost total public ignorance.
    In the ten years prior to 1937 only five stories about <span id="marijuana">marijuana</span>, or other
    Indian <span id="hemp">Hemp</span> derivatives such as <span id="hashish">hashish</span>, were listed in the Reader's
    Guide to Periodical Literature.</p>

    <a href="#hemp">Hemp</a>

<p>But for all the lack of publicity, the congressional hearings in 1937
    reflect unanimity that America was facing a vast and dangerous threat.
    Not a single expert or other witness questioned that <span id="marijuana">marijuana</span> often
    induced violent crimes.</p>
    <a href="#marijuana">Marijuana</a>

<p>But how was this known since "a problem" was not noticeable until
    the mid-1930's? Only in the 1920's was there any significant usage by
    even the Mexican-American communities in border cities, and only in the
    mid and late 1920's did Negro, jazz musicians and "degenerate" bohemian
    sub-cultures start smoking <span id="marijuana">marijuana</span>. Even the most lurid journalists did
    not claim that <span id="marijuana">marijuana</span> "seeped" into society at large until the 1930's
    and usually the mid-1930's.</p>
    <a href="#marijuana">Marijuana</a>

<p>The "evidence" problem could not be met by laboratory studies
    because the problem was too new, the cause too urgent, and the conse-
    quence of human subjects too risky. In 1938, the Federal Commissioner
    of Narcotics opined:</p>

<blockquote>Our only way of testing it is to try it on dogs. If the dog's legs get tan-
    gled up, the drug is potent. If you go on giving the dog <span id="marijuana">marijuana</span>, his
    brain is destroyed.</blockquote>
    <a href="#marijuana">Marijuana</a>

<p>The few foreign studies were usually too remote in time, place, method of
    imbibing, and user population to warrant translation. Two hastily conducted surveys 
    on prisoners yielded contrary results. The Federal Bureau
    of Narcotics did gather dozens of case histories of probable <span id="marijuana">marijuana</span>-
    induced violent crimes.</p>
    <a href="#marijuana">Marijuana</a>

<p>Yet no U. S. case seemed so authentic and convincing as the story of
    the <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span>. <span id="HarryAnsiinger">Harry Ansiinger</span>, Commissioner of the FBN from its incep-
    tion in 1930, until retiring in 1962, recounted the story in the 1937
    American Magazine.</p>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>
    <a href="#HarryAnsiinger">Harry Ansiinger</a>

<blockquote>In the year <span id="year1090">1090</span>, there was founded in <span class="location" id="Persia">Persia</span> the religious and military
    order of the <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span>, whose history is one of cruelty, barbarity, and
    murder, and for good reason. The members were confirmed users of
    <span id="hashish">hashish</span>, or <span id="marijuana">marijuana</span>, and it is from the Arabis "hashshashin" that we
    have the English word "<span id="Assassins">assassin</span>."</blockquote>

<p>The reader of Hygeia Magazine, put out by the American Medical Asso-
    ciation, would learn that "Oriental thugs long ago learned that <span id="hashish">hashish</span>
    produced the proper mental state to prepare one for commission of a
    heinous crime. In fact, the English word '<span id="Assassins">assassin</span>' is derived from the
    Arabic 'hashishin,' or '<span id="hemp">hemp</span>-eaters'."4 Readers of the 1935 American
    Mercury ,5 the 1938 Christian Century 8 or 1949 Forum and Century Maga-
    zine1 would read similar statements. Considering how few articles there
    were about <span id="marijuana">marijuana</span> in the 1930's, these mentions of The <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span>
    assume the proportion of major "facts".</p>

    <a href="#hemp">Hemp</a>

<p>In Popular Science Magazine of 1936, there appears a slightly dif-
    ferent version of the story:</p>

<blockquote>. . . "<span id="Assassins">assassin</span>" has two explanations, but either demonstrates the menace
    of Indian <span id="hemp">hemp</span>. According to one version, members of a band of Persion 
    terrorists committed their worst atrocities while under the influence 
    of <span id="hashish">hashish</span>. In the other version, Saracens who opposed the 
    Crusaders were said to employ the services of <span id="hashish">hashish</span> addicts to secure secret
    murders of the leaders of the Crusades. In both versions, the murderers
    were known as "haschischin." . . .</blockquote>
    <a href="#hemp">Hemp</a>
    <a href="#hashish">Hashish</a>

<p>In either case "further research was not necessary ." America could not
    afford to become a new base for "<span id="Assassins">assassins</span>."</p>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>

<p>The <span id="Assassins">Assassin</span> story did not originate in the mass media during the
    mid-1930,s. In the New Orleans Medical and Surgical Journal of 1931,
    an article begins with tales of the Hashishin.</p>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>

<blockquote>This diabolical, fanatical, cruel and murderous tribe. . . . Under the in-
    fluence of <span id="hashish">hashish</span> those fanatics would madly rush at their enemies, and
    ruthlessly massacre every one within their grasp.</blockquote>
    <a href="#hashish">Hashish</a>

<p>Hardly the work of stealthy, secret assassins, but definitely fanatical.</p>

<p>Four years previously an article on "The Green Goddess" in Medical
    Journal and Record takes the reader further into the tale. <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span>
    tells of the Land of the Assassins where killers take <span id="hashish">hashish</span> before com-
    mitting murder. Though the author concludes that <span id="hashish">hashish</span> was taken to
    bolster courage and induce madness prior to murder, when he quotes
    <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span>'s story of <span id="hashish">hashish</span>-orgies 
    it appears that the <span id="hashish">hashish</span> is the
    reward, not the cause, of the murders.</p>
    <a href="#MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</a>
    <a href="#hashish">Hashish</a>

<p>The fullest story about The <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span> in an article on <span id="marijuana">marijuana</span> or
    <span id="hashish">hashish</span>, is in the 1912 Medical Review of Reviews. It was quickly for-
    gotten. <span id="Robinson">Robinson</span>, the author, gives this interpretation of The <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountains</span> 
    cited in <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span>:</p>
    <a href="#MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</a>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>
    <a href="#hashish">Hashish</a>

<blockquote>When a Devoted One was selected to commit murder, he was first
    stupefied with <span id="hashish">hasheesh</span>, and while in this state was brought into the
    magnificent gardens of the sheikh. All the sensual and stimulating pleasures 
    of the erotic Orient surrounded the excited youth, and exalted by
    the delicious <span id="opiate">opiate</span> he had taken, the hot-blooded fanatic felt that the
    gates of heaven were already ajar, and heard them swing open on their
    golden hinges. When the effect of the drug disappeared and the Devoted 
    One was reduced to his normal condition, he was informed that through
    the generosity of his superior he had been permitted to foretaste the delights of 
    paradise. The Devoted One believed this readily enough -
    disciples are always credulous - and therefore was eager to die or to kill
    at a word from his master. From these <span id="hashish">hasheesh</span>-eaters, the Arabian
    name of which is hashshashin, was derived the term "<span id="Assassins">assassin</span>."</blockquote>
    <a href="#hashish">Hashish</a>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>
    <a href="#opiate">Opiate</a>
    

<p>This story has opposite implications from the one recounted by
    <span id="HarryAnsiinger"> Ansiinger</span> and others in the 1930's. Rather than killing under 
    the influence of <span id="hashish">hasheesh</span>, the "<span id="Assassins">assassins</span>" murdered 
    only after the drug was taken
    away. The <span id="Assassins">assassins</span> killed for a mellow exotic paradise, not in the throes of
    mad violence. The killings appear premeditated, not spur-of-the-moment
    lunacies. The "suggestion" planted in the minds of the devoted killers
    occurs after the <span id="hashish">hasheesh</span> was consumed, not while it is having an effect.
    But why believe a single 1912 article in an obscure journal, written
    by an obviously biased man? Yet, why not? It is obviously time to return
    to the original.</p>

<h2><span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span>'s Tale</h2>

<p><span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> describes a paradise which makes <span id="Robinson">Robinson</span>'s version
    pale.</p>
    <a href="#MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</a>
    <a href="#Robinson">Robinson</a>
    
<blockquote>In a valley between two mountains (The <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man</span>) had made the larg-
    est and finest garden that ever was seen. In it there were all the good
    fruits in the world ... the fairest houses and the most beautiful pal-
    aces . . . covered with gilding, and adorned with the pictures of all the
    beautiful things of the earth . . . conduits . . . flowed <span id="wine">wine</span> . . . milk
    . . . honey, and . . . water. There were also ladies and damsels there,
    the fairest on earth, who could play on all kinds of instruments, and sang
    and danced better than other women. And the <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man</span> made his people
    believe that this garden was Paradise.</blockquote>
    <a href="#OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</a>
    <a href="#wine">Wine</a>

<p>With all due disrespect to the ignorant young Saracen men of the 11th
    century, it seems fairly easy to understand how they were so persuaded.
    <span id="MarcoPolo">Polo</span> continues:</p>
    <a href="#MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</a>

<blockquote>Into that garden no man ever entered except those he wished to make
    <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span>. . . . The <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man</span> 
    kept with him at his court all the young
    men of the district, from twelve to twenty years of age. . . . The <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man</span>
    used to have these youths put in the garden ... he did it in the
    following way: he had a potion given them as a result of which they
    straightaway fell asleep; then he had them taken up and put into the
    garden, and then awakened. When they awoke . . . (they) so believed
    that they were really in paradise. And the young ladies and damsels re-
    mained with them all day . . . and the young men had their pleasure
    of them. So these youths had all they could desire, and would never have
    left the place of their own free will. 
    When the <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man</span>  wanted to send any of his men anywhere to kill
    some person, he would order the potion to be given to a certain num-
    ber of them, and once they were asleep, he would have them taken up
    and brought into his palace. When the youths awoke . . . they would
    be greatly amazed and by no means pleased. . . . They would now go
    into the presence of the <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man</span>  . . . believing that they were in the
    presence of a great Prophet. The <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man</span>  would then ask them whence
    they came, and they would answer they came from Paradise. The other
    youths, who had not been there and were present at the narrative, would
    then be consumed by the desire to go to the Paradise, feeling ready to
    die in order to be able to do so, and longing for the day when it would
    come about.</blockquote>
    <a href="#OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</a>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>

<p>The <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> story is unexpected, for even <span id="Robinson">Robinson</span>'s 
    1912 version is inaccurate, although close. It is not those who have tasted of the
    <span id="hashish">hashish</span>-tinted paradise who willingly kill but those who have not been
    there, (just as it is not the sated satyr who kills for sex but the horny
    "have-not").</p>
    <a href="#MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</a>
    <a href="#Robinson">Robinson</a>
    <a href="#hashish">Hashish</a>

    
<p>In fact, close reading of <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> suggests the presence of two
    drugs: probably an <span id="opiate">opiate</span> used for drugging young men to sleep for
    purposes of entering and exiting them without their knowledge, and free-
    flowing conduits of <span id="wine">wine</span>. <span id="hashish">Hashish</span> appears nowhere! 
    <span id="Robinson">Robinson</span> errs in
    claiming that <span id="hashish">hasheesh</span> was the "delicious <span id="opiate">opiate</span>" first given the youths,
    and compounds the error by claiming that normality returns when the
    <span id="opiate">opiate</span> wears off. In fact, heaven doesn't even begin until the <span id="opiate">opiate</span> wears
    off, and it ends when the <span id="opiate">opiate</span> is taken again. But at least the 1912
    version understands that it is not the paradisiacal state which causes 
    murder but the frustrated desire to return to it.</p>   
    <a href="#MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</a>
    <a href="#hashish">Hashish</a>
    <a href="#wine">Wine</a>
    <a href="#opiate">Opiate</a>
    <a href="#Robinson">Robinson</a>
    
<p>Given the <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> story there is more reason to call deliberate
    political-religious murderers "alcoholins" or "opiins" or even "frustratins"
    than to derive "<span id="Assassins">assassins</span>."</p>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>
    
<p>But obviously "<span id="Assassins">assassin</span>" has been derived, and 
    (unless all the translations that I have read miss his mention of <span id="hashish">hashish</span>) 
    <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> has
    nothing to do with it. Even if <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> included <span id="hashish">hashish</span> in his descrip-
    tion of the Assassins, there would be no reason to believe his tale. Yule, a
    scholar on <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span>, notes that "Romantic as this story is, it seems to
    be precisely the same that was current all over the East." A leading historian 
    specializing in The <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span> - <span id="BernardLewis">Bernard Lewis</span>
    - asserts:</p>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>
    <a href="#hashish">Hashish</a>
    <a href="#MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</a>
    <a href="#BernardLewis">Bernard Lewis</a>

<blockquote>The stories told by <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> and other eastern and western sources
    of the "gardens of paradise" into which the drugged devotees were introduced uced 
    to receive a foretaste of the eternal bliss that awaited them after
    the successful completion of their missions are not confirmed by any
    known Isma'ilite source.</blockquote>
    
<h2>The Historian's Version</h2>   
    
<p>Discarding <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> and turning to modern historians, one finds
    an Isma'ilite sect established by <span id="HassanbenSabbah">Hassan ben Sabbah</span> in <span id="year1090">1090</span> dubbed
    Haschischin or <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span> by neighboring Moslems and invading 
    Crusaders alike. But how evil was this sea and what evidence is there that their
    foulest deeds were <span id="hashish">hashish</span> induced?</p>
    <a href="#hashish">Hashish</a>
    <a href="#MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</a>
    <a href="#year1090">1090</a>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>
    <a href="#HassanbenSabbah">Hassan ben Sabbah</a>

<p>First, were the Haschischin so-called because they used <span id="hashish">hashish</span>?
    Ergo, did they use <span id="hashish">hashish</span> for religious motives? 
    There are two dissenting views. <span id="EdwardFitzgerald">Edward Fitzgerald</span>, 
    until his death the leading translator and
    commentator on <span id="OmarKayyam">OmarKayyam</span>, suggests that Assassin may derive from
    <span id="HassanbenSabbah">Hassan</span> (The <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man</span>), 
    not <span id="hashish">hashish</span>. <span id="BernardLewis">Lewis</span> mentions "a Jewish writer
    in Constantinople in the mid-twelfth century . . . (who) says that the
    Hashishiyah were so called because they dismissed the things of this world
    as so much grass (<span id="hashish">hashish</span>)". None the less, the prevailing historical
    view is that <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span> took <span id="hashish">hashish</span> "in order to induce ecstatic visions of
    paradise and thereby fortify themselves to face martyrdom."</p>

    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>
    <a href="#HassanbenSabbah">Hassan ben Sabbah</a>

<p>Assuming they probably used <span id="hashish">hashish</span>, I pose the second question:
    how murderous were the <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span>? From the beginning the followers of
    <span id="HassanbenSabbah">Hassan</span> had a bad press from neighbors as well as touring Crusaders.</p> 
    <a href="#hashish">Hashish</a>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>
    <a href="#HassanbenSabbah">Hassan ben Sabbah</a>
    
<blockquote>. . . (their) chroniclers are usuallly . . . hostile . . . lived at a time
    of military orthodoxy and counter-crusade. ... In the strongly reli-
    gious atmosphere of the late twelfth and thirteenth centures no more
    damning charge could be brought against a Muslim priest than that of
    complicity with the dreaded <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span>, and even those whose own hands
    were not clean in this respect did not hesitate to use it.</blockquote>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>

<p>The <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span> were the red-baited victims of their time, analogous to the
    Tito'ists of 1950 - labelled barbaric murderers by their Western 
    adversaries and a hated and maligned radical sert by their fellow, if more ortho-
    dox, members of the larger religious order.</p>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>
    
<p>True <span id="HassanbenSabbah">Hassan</span> was not a total innocent, but his tactic was not without
    precedence. Three hundred years before <span id="HassanbenSabbah">Hassan ben Sabbah</span> an Isma'ilite
    sect had "practiced the strangling of opponents with cords as a religious
    duty - an obvious reflection of Indian Thugee." Further, "the adjoining  provinces 
    of Dailam and Azerbaijan had long been centers of extremist
    heresy, and offered a ready recruiting ground from which al-Hasan formed
    his corps of fida'is, the fanatical and utterly devoted instruments of his
    war of terror." Thus, the <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span> seem almost typical for their time and
    place, and need not have resorted to <span id="hashish">hashish</span> or any other drug. There
    might even have been reasonable cause for their vicious tactic which
    "seemed to offer the only effective challenge to the (Crusader) invaders
    of their country." For a time this made them quite popular with Muslim
    neighbors. The modern maligning of Hassan hardly seems fitting for this
    early Freedom-fighter.</p> 
    <a href="#HassanbenSabbah">Hassan ben Sabbah</a>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>
    <a href="#hashish">Hashish</a>
    
<p>But how or where does <span id="hashish">hashish</span> link up with the assassinations? It
    apparently has no link. "The <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span> were no mere band of hired cut-
    throats, but the fanatically devoted adherents of a religious sect." Reli-
    gion leads to assassinations, not <span id="hashish">hashish</span>. 
    The supposed <span id="hashish">hashish</span>-induced
    "visions of paradise" are as responsible for the assassinations as the 
    religiously fortifying drinking of <span id="wine">wine</span> and eating of wafers are responsible
    for the bloody Crusades.</p>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>
    <a href="#hashish">Hashish</a>
    <a href="#wine">Wine</a>

<p>It is possible that one or two obscure sources may yet turn up
    connecting <span id="hashish">hashish</span> with the Isma'ilite murders, but the counter-evidence is
    so conclusive that the <span id="Assassins">Assassin</span> story, as recounted by anti-<span id="marijuana">marijuana</span> advo-
    cates in America, should be dismissed. Eleventh century folklore cannot
    be a basis for an important twentieth century prohibition.</p>

<h2>If the Truth Should Out . . .</h2>

<p>If anyone is to take either <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span> or the historian's evidence to
    their logical conclusion he must accept that <span id="hashish">hashish</span> was - if anything -
    an essential ingredient of an exquisite paradisiacal beauty, which men
    were ready and willing to kill and die for. How different is this than the
    murder one would commit for the love of a beautiful woman? (In Texas,
    as well as Sicily, such murder was until recently legal as well as 
    understandable.) Murdering to regain the paradise of either <span id="hashish">hashish</span> or the
    love of a beautiful woman is based on the scarcity principal. Were love
    and beautiful women everywhere abundant than the cuckolded killer
    would be merely a fool. Likewise, the mythical <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span> 
    thrived because of scarcity. Were the joys of <span id="hashish">hashish</span> and paradise on
    earth available to all, the <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man</span> would be but another forgotten tribal
    chief, a leader without followers. The lesson for America of the 1930's
    would then have been to make <span id="marijuana">marijuana</span> available for all, cheaply.</p>

    <a href="#MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</a>
    <a href="#hashish">Hashish</a>
    
<p>Proponents of legalizing <span id="marijuana">marijuana</span> may despair because the myth
    of <span id="hemp">hemp</span>-induced assassination has survived almost 900 years and recent official 
    assertions of it have never been challenged. Take heart lads!
    Trousers were invented by nomads around 1,000 B.C. (to prevent chafed
    legs) . Trousers became closely identified with barbarians, an imperial edict
    banned their use by Romans, and even in 1814 the Duke of Wellington
    was refused to his club because he wore trousers. Though slow, the pace
    of scientific verification seems to be quickening.</p>

<p>Times and habits change suddenly, and the upsurge of <span id="marijuana">marijuana</span>
    usage in the U. S. this decade is but one example. An earlier parallel case
    is that of the tomato:</p>
    <a href="#marijuana">Marijuana</a>
    
<blockquote>... it was first cultivated to be sold as decoration for the home. Chil-
    dren were cautioned not to eat them, and those who did were quickly
    purged by a physician. Later, Italian dandies decided that the tomato
    spurred the carnal passions, and they started eating tomatoes mixed with
    garlic and olive oil. The British and French - hearing of this - started
    gnawing on tomatoes surreptitiously, and eventually the fruit became
    respectable.</blockquote>
    
<p>When such rapid shifts occur, the focus changes from the maddening
    effects of the habit to the mentality of those who interpreted the habit as
    harmful to begin with. The student of <span id="marijuana">Marijuana</span> and the law will find
    nothing of interest in the tales of the <span id="Assassins">Assassin</span> - except for the doubt
    it raises about the government, medical, and mass media experts who relied
    on ancient myths, and then twisted them almost beyond recognition.</p>
