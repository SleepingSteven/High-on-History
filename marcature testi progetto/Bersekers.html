    Abstract
</h3>

<p>
    Ethnopharmacological relevance: The <span id="norse">Norse</span> <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> were wild warriors of 
    <span id="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</span> known to enter a
    <span id="trance">trance</span>-like state that allowed them to fight with increased strength and a rage that granted them immunity to
    many forms of harm in battle. Though many theories have been advanced as to the cause of this state, the most
    widely believed is that the intoxicating <span id="mushroom">mushroom</span> <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> was used.
    Aim of the study: The following article underlines the issues with this theory and provides an alternate intoxicant
    that fits with the reports of <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> behaviour much better: <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span>.
    Materials and methods: Literature from a variety of disciplines pertaining to history, toxicology, pharmacology,
    and botany was compiled to frame and support the argument.
    Results: <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> proved to be a more likely intoxicant used to induce 
    the <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> rage state.
    Conclusions: With its anticholinergic tropane <span id="alkaloids">alkaloids</span> and symptom profile, 
    <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> is a much more likely cause
    of the <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> state than <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>. 
    Though there is not enough archaeological and historical evidence to
    prove or disprove this theory, it provides a novel explanation that is at present the most viable means of understanding 
    the <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span>' <span id="trance">trance</span>.

<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>

<p>
    Intoxicating plants of the botanical family Solanaceae have found
    use across both time and space for a variety of purposes. Whether it is
    <span id="brugmansia">Brugmansia</span> being occasionally added to 
    the famous <span id="ayahuasca">Ayahuasca</span> of
    South/Central America (De Rios, 1970) or <span id="daturaStramonium">Datura stramonium L.</span> being
    added to cider in France (Prado, 2004), these plants have played important religious, medicinal, and recreational roles for humans from
    many cultures. Though this family, which contains many common food
    plants such as tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and peppers, is not as
    widely employed by humans as grasses and legumes, it still ranks
    among the most used groups of plants (Boyd et al., 1984). This is also
    one of the few botanical families that contains a disproportionally high
    number of <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> plants, with some of its members containing
    <span id="hyoscyamine">hyoscyamine</span>/<span id="atropine">atropine</span> and <span id="scopolamine">scopolamine</span>, tropane <span id="alkaloids">alkaloids</span> with <span id="psychoactive">mindaltering</span> powers 
    (Adamse et al., 2014; Alrashedy and Molina, 2016).
    These substances are, however, not like most <span id="hallucinogen">hallucinogens</span>, and are
    classified as deliriants for their strong <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> effects that cloud
    the mind and cause intense and realistic <span id="hallucinogen">hallucinations</span> (Díaz, 2010).
    These plants have also been frequently implicated as being associated
    with the witches of Europe and their supposed <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> flying
    ointments (Carruthers, 2015).

<p>
    Along with the famed witches, another widely known group from 
    Europe existed that is often said to have made use of a <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span>
    substance: the <span id="norse">Norse</span> <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span>. Known for their ferocity, 
    these warriors were said to enter a special <span id="trance">trance</span> that aided them in battle (Dale,
    2017; Fabing, 1956; Wade, 2016). The substance generally implicated
    in the entering of this <span id="trance">trance</span> state is 
    the famous <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> <span id="mushroom">mushroom</span>, 
    <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria L.</span> Such notions of the <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> 
    <span id="trance">trance</span> being
    caused by <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> go back (at least) as far as the 1700s when the
    theory was recorded by the famed writer, Ödmann (1784). Ergotism,
    alcohol, mental illness, and many other theories have been put forward
    since, however <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> seems to be the most widely accepted
    theory to date (Alm and Elvevåg, 2012; Dale, 2017).

<p>
    <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>, however, does not fully match the reported profile of
    <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> warriors; a solanaceous plant containing 
    <span id="hyoscyamine">hyoscyamine</span>/<span id="atropine">atropine</span> and <span id="scopolamine">scopolamine</span> seems a much better fit. This, however, leaves a
    multitude of possible plants. When the range of these plants and their
    distribution during the time of the <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> is taken into account,
    however, it seems that the best fit is <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger L.</span> As such,
    <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> is a more plausible cause of the <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> state than
    <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> based on the evidence that we have available to us at
    present.

<h2>
    <span id="berserkers">Berserkers</span>
</h2>

<p>
    Exactly who the <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> were is a matter of controversy in itself.
    Originally, the term is thought to have emerged in reference to a specific 
    hero in <span id="norse">Norse</span> mythology who fought without armour, thus leaving
    him “ber sark” or bare skinned (Fabing, 1956). Then, during the Saga
    period (870–1030 CE) in <span id="Iceland">Iceland</span> and <span id="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</span>, a group of warriors
    arose known by the same name before their sudden disappearance
    around the <span id="12thcenturyCE">12th century CE</span> (Fabing, 1956). Actual direct references,
    however, are often unclear; even the meaning of the word <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> has
    been thought to perhaps mean “bear skin” rather than “bare skin” and
    refer to these warriors wearing bear or animal pelts in their battles
    (Liberman, 2004; Wade, 2016). This lack of information exists in large
    part due to the fact that knowledge of the <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> was not recorded
    substantially until after the tradition had been outlawed by the Christian 
    church while seeking to stamp out paganism and because the
    writings that did exist were often made by Christian writers with an
    agenda to denounce these traditions (Wade, 2016). Some archaeological 
    items from the period display images of warriors whose bodies
    are covered in animal skins, and various myths among the <span id="norse">Norse</span> 
    peoples point to warriors dressing in the skins of bears and wolves to gain
    their ferocity, but there is no concrete way to associate these 
    phenomena (Wade, 2016). Iconography from the period does also seem to
    display that <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> were among the social elite of the time, though
    this too is open to interpretation (Dale, 2017). Ultimately, all that can
    be said with certainty is that they were elite warriors who were known
    for their recklessness in battle and that they may have fought without
    armour (Liberman, 2004).

<p>
    The <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> were said to be not just ordinary warriors, but rather
    to fight while in a specific <span id="trance">trance</span>-like state, which was likely helpful in
    dissociating them from the close-up atrocities they would have seen and
    committed in battle (Wade, 2016). This state has been variously
    claimed to involve anger, increased strength, a dulled sense of pain,
    decreases in their levels of humanity and reason, behaviour akin to that
    of wild animals (including howling and biting on their shields), shivering, 
    chattering of their teeth, chill in the body, and invulnerability to
    iron (swords) as well as fire (Dale, 2017; Fabing, 1956; Speidel, 2002;
    Wade, 2016). Additionally, they were said to attack enemies indiscriminately 
    with no sense of friend or foe and to throw off their armour
    in battle (Fabing, 1956; Wade, 2016).
</p>
<a href="#berserkers">Berserkers</a>
<a href="#trance">trance</a>

<p>
    When the state wore off after about one day, the <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> were
    said to experience several days of weakness and dulled mental capacity
    (Fabing, 1956). Reports also seem to point to clubs being needed to
    defeat <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> since blades could not harm them; this has been 
    interpreted by some as potential proof of the term <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> referring to
    warriors who wore animal skins, since pelts would provide some 
    protection against the cutting of swords but would do very little to protect
    from the blunt trauma involved in attacks with clubs (Dale, 2017).

<p>
    Though often thought of out of context within popular culture, it
    has been suggested that the <span id="norse">Norse</span> <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> were in fact part of a
    larger tradition of Indo-European “ecstatic” warriors who made use of
    <span id="trance">trance</span>-like states in battle (Speidel, 2002).

    <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span>
</h2>

<p>
    <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> is a <span id="mushroom">mushroom</span> of up to 20 cm in height; the
    European form has a red cap, often bearing white flecks of old tissue,
    and is almost equally as wide as it is tall at maturity once it has 
    flattened into an archetypical toadstool shape (Schultes, Hofmann, &
    Rätsch, 2001). Eurasian in origin, this species has now been introduced
    to various other parts of the world (Geml et al., 2008). It primarily
    grows in acidic soils in birch forests and is most prevalent from late
    summer to early autumn (Czigany, 1980; Lee et al., 2018). 
    Discovered in 1869, muscarine was originally thought to be the
    compound responsible for the <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> effects of <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>
    (Schultes, 1977). This substance, however, proved to be a minor
    constituent of the alkaloid profile of the <span id="mushroom">mushroom</span>, and to merely be a
    cause of many unpleasant physiological side effects associated with the
    use of <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> (Feeney, 2010). Nearly a century later, the true
    <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> components were isolated, proving to be <span id="muscimol">muscimol</span> and
    <span id="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>, though to this day it remains unclear if other as of yet
    unknown substances also play a role (Feeney, 2010; Halpern, 2004; Lee
    et al., 2018).

<p>
    The most abundant of the principal compounds, <span id="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>, 
    appears in levels as high as 40 g/kg dry weight, though this quantity
    varies vastly, with another study, for example, reporting <span id="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>
    as only 1 g/kg dry weight of <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> (Feeney, 2010; Lee et al.,
    2018; Lumpert and Kreft, 2016). Though high in content, this substance
    is 5–10 times weaker in <span id="psychoactive">psychoactivity</span> than its counterpart, <span id="muscimol">muscimol</span>
    (Feeney, 2010).

<a href="#psychoactive">psychoactive</a>
<a href="#muscimol">muscimol</a>

<p>
    Likely the primary cause of <span id="psychoactive">psychoactivity</span> in 
    <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>, <span id="muscimol">muscimol</span>
    is formed through the decarboxylation of <span id="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>; this occurs
    through dehydration of the <span id="mushroom">mushroom</span>'s tissues, but may also occur in
    the human stomach (Feeney, 2010; Lee et al., 2018). Along with 
    <span id="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>, these compounds are both excreted in human urine to 
    various degrees (Støíbrný et al., 2012). These two substances also offer an
    explanation regarding the vast variability in the <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> effects of
    <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>, with seasonal variations in the ratio between <span id="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>
    and <span id="muscimol">muscimol</span> likely being the cause (Lee et al., 2018; Schultes, 1977).
    This may explain why various groups in the far east of <span id="Siberia">Siberia</span> who were
    known for making use of this <span id="mushroom">mushroom</span> preferred spring and summer
    specimens to those arising in autumn (Brekham, 1967).

<a href="#Siberia">Siberia</a>

<p>
    Traditional use also aligns with what has come to be known of the
    chemistry of <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span>. Known to be used by a variety of tribes
    in the extreme northeast and extreme west of <span id="Siberia">Siberia</span> for their religious
    rituals, these <span id="mushroom">mushrooms</span> were often dried before being eaten, or were
    made into infusions over the course of 5–6 days (Brekham, 1967;
    Czigany, 1980; Lee et al., 2018; Schultes, 1969; Wasson, 1967). This
    drying would, as previously mentioned, serve to convert <span id="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>
    into <span id="muscimol">muscimol</span>, thus making the <span id="mushroom">mushrooms</span> more potent. As for the
    infusions, <span id="muscimol">muscimol</span> is more soluble than <span id="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span>, so a beverage
    made from <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> would effectively extract the most <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span>
    portion of the <span id="mushroom">mushroom</span> (Feeney, 2010). A typical experience among
    the <span id="Siberia">Siberian</span> tribes involved a drunken state associated with auditory
    <span id="hallucinogen">hallucinations</span> and changes in the colour of the consumer's vision; it was
    even claimed that reindeer would follow the shamans around to eat
    snow into which they urinated, thus themselves getting high (Lee et al.,
    2018).

<a href="#hallucinogen">Hallucinations</a>

<p>
    <span id="muscimol">Muscimol</span> acts as a strong GABA-A agonist, especially in the central
    nervous system (Satora et al., 2005), though its <span id="hallucinogen">hallucinogenic</span> action
    has been reported to arise primarily from its binding at GABA-B sites
    (Mikaszewska-Sokolewicz et al., 2016). In contrast, <span id="ibotenicAcid">ibotenic acid</span> acts
    most strongly at N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors by 
    agonising for glutamic acid (Krogsgaard-Larsen et al., 1981; Satora et al.,
    2005). The previously discussed muscarine has cholinergic effects 
    related to the peripheral nervous system in smooth muscles of the body,
    but is not prone to entering the central nervous system, which further
    explains why it is unable to be the substance responsible for the 
    <span id="hallucinogen">hallucinogenic</span> actions of <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> (Krogsgaard-Larsen et al., 1981;
    Waser, 1967). The multiple effects of these substances significantly
    limits their potential usefulness in clinical settings (Krogsgaard-Larsen
    et al., 1981).

<p>
    Effects of <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> ingestion include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
    hyperthermia, intense sweating, reddening of the face, excessive 
    salivation, dizziness, twitching/trembling, dilated pupils, increased muscle
    tone, <span id="hallucinogen">hallucinations</span>, delirium, seizures, sleep, coma, and possibly death
    in rare cases (Davis and Williams, 1999; Fabing, 1956; Kirchmair et al.,
    2012; Michelot and Melendez-Howell, 2003; Mikaszewska-Sokolewicz
    et al., 2016; Satora et al., 2005; Schultes, 1969). Though aggressiveness
    and hyperactivity may occur, these symptoms are rare and not seen as
    common markers of <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> poisoning (Brvar et al., 2006; Schultes,
    1969). <span id="hallucinogen">Hallucinations</span> may take as long as 1.5 h after consumption to 
    occur, while gastro-intestinal symptoms arise much more quickly, with
    nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea beginning within 15 min
    (Mikaszewska-Sokolewicz et al., 2016). Though reports from the 
    literature involving intoxications with this <span id="mushroom">mushroom</span> are fairly rare,
    enough exist to validate the symptoms often reported (Brvar et al.,
    2006; Mikaszewska-Sokolewicz et al., 2016; Waser, 1967).

<p>
    <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> is a pubescent and aromatic annual or biennial
    with dentate ovate leaves of about 20 cm in length; reaching a height of
    about 75 cm, this plant bears scorpoidal cymes of small yellow flowers
    with purple centres and veins, which later mature into capsules
    (Schultes et al., 2001). Originating from the Mediterranean/Balkan
    region of Europe, <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> has since found its way throughout Eurasia
    and North America, where it normally grows in waste areas as a weed
    (Daunay et al., 2007; Goyal et al., 2009; Hocking, 1947; Passos and
    Mironidou-Tzouveleki, 2016).

<a href="#HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</a>

<p>
    As with some of its familial relatives such as species in the genera
    Atropa, <span id="brugmansia">Brugmansia</span>, <span id="daturaStramonium">Datura</span>, Mandragora, and Scopolia, the genus
    <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus</span> contains tropane <span id="alkaloids">alkaloids</span>. In particular, it contains the
    <span id="alkaloids">alkaloids</span> <span id="hyoscyamine">hyoscyamine</span> (of which <span id="atropine">atropine</span> is a racemic mixture of both
    enantiomers) and <span id="scopolamine">scopolamine</span>. Research has shown the leaves and
    flowers of <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> to contain 0.05–0.14% <span id="alkaloids">alkaloids</span>, with <span id="scopolamine">scopolamine</span>
    being the principal constituent and representing approximately 50% of
    this content (Arroo et al., 2007; Gaillard and Pepin, 1999). Though
    <span id="hyoscyamine">hyoscyamine</span>/<span id="atropine">atropine</span> is also <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span>, <span id="scopolamine">scopolamine</span> is much
    stronger, for example exhibiting an eight fold increase in central 
    nervous system activity when compared to <span id="atropine">atropine</span> (Ketchum et al., 1973).
    As previously mentioned, these <span id="alkaloids">alkaloids</span> are deliriants, known to 
    produce complex and convincing <span id="hallucinogen">hallucinations</span> (Maior et al., 2017).

<p>
    First isolated in the 1800s, <span id="scopolamine">scopolamine</span> has been found in all parts
    of the plant (Passos and Mironidou-Tzouveleki, 2016). This explains its
    extensive historical use in Europe since ancient Greece as a narcotic,
    anaesthetic, pain killer, cure for insomnia, in the treatment for 
    respiratory ailments, in the famous soporific sponge, and many more
    (Carter, 1996; Daunay et al., 2007; Gorun et al., 2011; Hocking, 1947;
    Kala and Ratajc, 2012; Lee and Schilling, 2006; Passos and 
    Mironidou-Tzouveleki, 2016; Piomelli and Pollio, 1994; Schultes, 1977). This plant
    has also found use in Tibetan medicine, traditional Chinese medicine,
    and Ayurveda for similar purposes (Goyal et al., 2009; Patočka and
    Jelínková, 2018). In western biomedicine, pure <span id="scopolamine">scopolamine</span> is still
    used for treating motion sickness (Grynkiewicz and Gadzikowska,
    2008).

<a href="#scopolamine">scopolamine</a>

<p>
    In addition to its medicinal uses, <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> is often claimed
    to have been a plant used by the witches of Europe (Schultes et al.,
    2001). It has been suggested that it was used in love potions, witches'
    brews, and in the famous <span id="hallucinogen">hallucinogenic</span> flying ointments (Aulakh and
    Mukerjee, 1984; Disel et al., 2015; Lee and Schilling, 2006). It is also
    thought by some to have been burned at the ancient oracle in Delphi
    thus allowing the seers to enter <span id="trance">trances</span> and receive their prophecies
    (Paulsen, 2010). Such magical uses are, however, largely conjecture;
    flying ointments, for example, are said by some to not have even existed
    (Ostling, 2016). It was also used extensively in Europe as a means of
    fortifying beer, and for making other forms of <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> beverages
    (Kromar, 1979; Lee and Schilling, 2006). So often was it used that a law
    was passed in 1507 in what is now Germany to prohibit its use in the
    making of ales (Daunay et al., 2007). Repeated use was also known to
    cause insanity, but this did not impact its popularity as it likely 
    presented a form of intoxicant available even to the poorest people who
    could not afford more costly pleasures (Müller, 1998; Schultes, 1969).
    Indeed, repeated doses above 3 mg per day have been shown to cause
    lasting behavioural and mental changes (Maior et al., 2017). 
    Additionally, the symptoms of <span id="norse">Norse</span> <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> warriors align somewhat
    with those ascribed to werewolves: wearing of animal pelts, raging, and
    irregular behaviour, which in turn line up with symptoms caused by the
    anticholinergic  <span id="alkaloids">tropane alkaloids</span>, believed by some to be the cause of
    the werewolf phenomenon (Copeland, 2018; Piomelli and Pollio,
    1994).

<p>
    The <span id="alkaloids">tropane alkaloids</span> 
    <span id="hyoscyamine">hyoscyamine</span>/<span id="atropine">atropine</span> 
    and <span id="scopolamine">scopolamine</span> antagonise 
    muscarine receptors in the central and peripheral nervous
    systems in the place of acetylcholine, thus earning them the title of
    anticholinergic substances (Sayin, 2016). Though five subtypes of
    muscarinic receptors exist in the human body, these substances do not
    selectively bond to any one type and thus cause a wide range of
    symptoms (Gadzikowska and Grynkiewicz, 2002). Their effects are
    especially pronounced in the smooth muscles and secretory glands of
    the body as well as in the brain (Moulton and Fryer, 2011; Simone and
    Margarucci, 2008). These substances produce virtually identical
    symptoms, though as previously mentioned <span id="scopolamine">scopolamine</span> presents a
    central nervous system effect that is eight times stronger than that seen
    with <span id="atropine">atropine</span> (Ketchum et al., 1973).

<p>
    These <span id="alkaloids">alkaloids</span> cause a range of effects such as decreased salivation
    (and thus dry mouth), slowed gut motility, dilation of pupils (and thus
    blurred vision), decreased bronchial secretion, decreased sweating (and
    thus drying of skin), bradycardia or tachycardia (depending on dosage),
    ataxia, hyperthermia, flushing of the skin, headache, hyperreflexia,
    incoordination, somnolence, restlessness, decreased ability to pay attention, 
    loss of coherent speaking, <span id="hallucinogen">hallucinations</span>, memory disturbances, 
    and eventually coma and death (Arroo et al., 2007; Brown
    and Laiken, 2011; Gadzikowska and Grynkiewicz, 2002; Ketchum et al.,
    1973; Maheshwari, 2013). These effects, however, are dose-dependent,
    and thus <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> can be used (and indeed still is in many places)
    without fatality or the more extreme symptoms. Reports of poisoning
    arising from this plant are not highly prevalent in the literature (Aparna
    et al., 2015; Erkal, 2006; Sands and Sands, 1976; Shams et al., 2017;
    Spoerke et al., 1987), however, related plants with the same <span id="alkaloids">alkaloids</span>
    such as <span id="daturaStramonium">Datura stramonium</span> have been extensively reported on in 
    toxicological papers, and from these we can glean information about the

<h2>
    Historical and archaeological perspectives
</h2>

<p>
    Though originally a Mediterranean species, <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> was
    likely introduced to <span id="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</span> as far back as the Roman Iron Age
    (Heimdahl, 2009). Since it was not native to the region, it has been
    suggested that this provides proof of the plant being brought further
    north and cultivated for its medicinal properties (Karg, 2010). Though
    this may be true, it cannot be dismissed as a theory that <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> may
    have migrated with humans accidentally and begun to spread as a
    weed. It is also worth noting that carbonised remains resulting from
    burning are the most likely plant tissues to survive in the archaeological
    record; paleobotanical finds may thus disproportionally represent
    plants that have been used in manners related to fire (Day, 2013).
    Whatever the reason for its migration, this plant was an established
    weed at centres of trade by the Viking age, making it a viable candidate
    for use by warriors of the time (Heimdahl, 2009).
</p>
<a href="#HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</a>
<a href="#Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>

<p>
    <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> seeds have been found in association with Viking
    age sites in Denmark (Rohde Sloth, Lund Hansen and Karg, 2013) and
    Finland (Vuorela et al., 1996), with signs of obvious cultivation of the
    plant tending to emerge around the middle ages (Alanko and Uotila,
    2017; Åsen, 2009; Heimdahl, 2009). Though the Viking age findings are
    inconclusive in many cases, it seems that the plant was being used at
    this time. Carbonised seeds as well as seeds associated with graves both
    suggest potential use in these sites. Additionally, a grave from 
    approximately 980 CE in Denmark included a pouch of <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> seeds with
    a woman whose clothing, jewellery, and other grave goods suggested
    she was a priestess/shaman of high social class who may have used the
    seeds to produce visions (Pentz et al., 2009). Though this cannot be
    proven without further archaeological findings, the fact that the seeds
    were in a pouch and buried with her suggests their importance and
    unequivocally points to some form of use in <span id="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</span> during the
    Viking age. This in itself provides a much more concrete argument for
    the use of <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> to produce 
    the <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> <span id="trance">trance</span> than any that may be
    claimed for <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>.

<p>
    Though <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> is invasive in many regions where it has
    been introduced, analysis of trade routes in <span id="Siberia">Siberia</span> has shown that it
    was not ubiquitous at the times when it was more widely used for ritual
    purposes there (Geml et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2018). Some authors have
    even suggested that the reason behind the drinking of urine of those
    who had consumed the <span id="mushroom">mushroom</span> was due to its shortage (Buck, 1963).
    Though this may be true, it could just as likely be an etic assumption on
    the part of European observers who were unaware of the ways in which
    the human body improves the substance by filtering out the 
    non-<span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> components responsible for many unpleasant physical effects.
    Regardless, <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> would have likely been much harder to come by
    than <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span>, with the former needing to grow in forests where its
    mycelium can create mutualistic relationships with the roots of the
    trees (Czigany, 1980; Geml et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2018). <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus
    niger</span>, in contrast, grows as a pesky weed and as previously mentioned is
    known to have done so in inhabited areas of <span id="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</span> during the
    period of the <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> (Heimdahl, 2009).

<p>
    Though records may not exist to prove that <span id="norse">Norse</span> <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> made
    use of <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> substances to induce their battle <span id="trance">trances</span>, Ödmann's
    writing from the 1700s on the topic also includes a potential 
    explanation: in order to guard their prestige and position in society, <span id="norse">Norse</span>
    <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> may have kept their use of intoxicants a secret (Fabing,
    1956). This would also prevent enemies from gaining access to their
    increased abilities. Though Ödmann writes of this in reference to
    <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span>, the theory applies equally well to <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span>.
    This also aligns with the general lack of knowledge of <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span>
    substance use in Europe; when the Christian church labelled such plants
    as heretical and suppressed their use and information about them, they
    effectively destroyed much of the tradition and knowledge that could
    be used in the present day to piece together the history of European
    <span id="psychoactive">psychoactive</span> plant use (Harner, 1973).

<h2>
    Analysis of symptomology
</h2>

<p>
    Perhaps the largest problem involved in untangling this historical
    mystery is the large degree of similarity seen between intoxications of
    the active compounds of <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> and those of 
    <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span>. So similar are the effects between these two organisms when
    consumed by humans that scientists spent many years searching for
    <span id="alkaloids">tropane alkaloids</span> in <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> (Buck, 1963; Waser, 1967). Despite the
    similarity of their symptoms, the substances have opposite chemical
    effects; <span id="atropine">atropine</span>, for example, is an antidote for muscarine poisoning
    (Kirchmair et al., 2012). Though there are many similarities in effects,
    it is worth noting that the increased salivation and sweating seen in <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>
    ingestion as well as the nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea are
    symptoms typical for this <span id="mushroom">mushroom</span> but not for plants containing 
    <span id="alkaloids">anticholinergic tropane alkaloids</span>; furthermore,  <span id="alkaloids">anticholinergic alkaloids</span>
    cause a marked decrease in salivation and perspiration, which stands in
    stark contrast to the effects of muscarine (Waser, 1967). Unfortunately,
    such symptoms are difficult to distinguish from historical records.

<a href="#atropine">atropine</a>

<p>
    As previously discussed, both substances may cause increases in
    strength, altered level of consciousness, wild/delirious behaviour,
    jerking/twitching, and redness of the face, all of which have been 
    associated with <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> (Brown and Laiken, 2011; Brvar et al., 2006;
    Dale, 2017; Davis and Williams, 1999; Fabing, 1956; Grynkiewicz and
    Gadzikowska, 2008; Gadzikowska and Grynkiewicz, 2002; Ketchum
    et al., 1973; Kirchmair et al., 2012; Michelot and Melendez-Howell,
    2003; Mikaszewska-Sokolewicz et al., 2016; Satora et al., 2005;
    Schultes, 1969; Speidel, 2002; Wade, 2016; Waser, 1967; Wasson,
    1967). What makes <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> a more compelling theoretical
    cause of the <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> state, however, is its additional symptoms that
    are not commonly seen in intoxications involving <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span>. In
    addition to the previous symptoms, <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span>'s <span id="alkaloids">alkaloids</span> also have pain
    killing effects unseen in the compounds within <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>, which may
    account for some of the reports of the supposed invulnerability of the
    <span id="norse">Norse</span> <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> (Dale, 2017; Fabing, 1956; Grynkiewicz and
    Gadzikowska, 2008; Hocking, 1947; Lee and Schilling, 2006; Passos
    and Mironidou-Tzouveleki, 2016; Piomelli and Pollio, 1994; Schultes,
    1977; Speidel, 2002; Wade, 2016). Even more compelling is the 
    duration of effects; though the <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> state has been reported to involve
    several days of side effects after the high has subsided, this is not a
    common feature in intoxications with <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> (Brvar et al.,
    2006; Fabing, 1956; Michelot and Melendez-Howell, 2003;
    Mikaszewska-Sokolewicz et al., 2016; Satora et al., 2005; Waser, 1967).
    <span id="alkaloids">Tropane alkaloids</span> from <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> and its close relatives, 
    however, are known to commonly have such effects lasting for many days,
    with some symptoms such as headache and dilated pupils (and thus
    blurred vision) lasting for weeks in some cases (Halpern, 2004). 
    Additionally, rage is not a common presenting symptom in cases 
    of <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>  consumption, but is prevalent in cases involving 
    <span id="alkaloids">anticholinergic tropane alkaloids</span> (Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention, 1995; DeFrates et al., 2005; Göpel et al., 2002; 
    Klein-Schwartz and Oderda, 1984; Lazzarini et al., 2006; Spina and Taddei,
    2007; Thiermann et al., 2009; Wiebe et al., 2008). Though these cases
    do not involve <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span>, they have been witnessed as a result of related
    plants containing the same <span id="alkaloids">alkaloids</span>, making a comparison here 
    appropriate. In addition, most reports have also observed these 
    behaviours in cases of <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> intoxication (Erkal, 2006; Sands and Sands,
    1976; Shams et al., 2017). This effect is also likely long known in
    Croatia, where the verb “buniti” meaning to fight or protest was derived
    from the local name for <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> (bunika), and a saying translating to “as
    if they had eaten <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span>” is used to refer to an angered 
    individual (Pronk, 2012). This anger effect can range from agitation to
    full-blown rage and combativeness depending on the dosage and the
    individual's mental set. As this is perhaps the most defining component
    of the <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> state, this symptom is of central importance in 
    identifying potential causes and provides a very critical reason as to 
    why <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> is a more appropriate theoretical intoxicant for the <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> than
    <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>.

<a href="#norse">Norse</a>

<p>
    Another commonly reported symptom in cases of intoxications with
    <span id="alkaloids">tropane alkaloids</span> from solanaceous plants involves an inability on the
    part of the intoxicated individual to recognise the faces of people they
    know (Adegoke and Alo, 2013; Berdai et al., 2012; Korkmaz et al.,
    2018; Villain et al., 2008). As it has been claimed that the <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span>
    did not distinguish between friends and foes in battle, it seems that such
    a mechanism could have been at play. Though this could also be due to
    <span id="hallucinogen">hallucinations</span> that could be caused by either intoxicant, it seems more
    likely that this element of confusion pertaining to identification is here
    implicated. The <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span>' fearlessness is also likely a result of this
    altered mental state produced by <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> and its <span id="alkaloids">alkaloids</span>.

<a href="#alkaloids">alkaloids</a>
<a href="#hallucinogen">Hallucinations</a>
<a href="#berserkers">Berserkers</a>
<a href="#HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</a>

<p>
    Yet another compelling possibility is their removal of clothing;
    though authors tend to claim that <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> would throw off their
    armour (and possibly their shirts, depending on which interpretation of
    the word <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> we employ) in battle to display their bravery, it is
    possible that this was a result of intoxication by <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span>. In
    many cases of intoxication by related solanaceous plants, individuals
    have been known to remove their clothing and be found walking
    around naked (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1995;
    Gangl-Žvikart, 2002; Kromar, 1979; Mikolich et al., 1975; Weil, 1977).
    This trend has also been displayed in my own ongoing research with
    individuals employing anticholinergic solanaceous plants for 
    recreational and spiritual purposes. Whether this is due to the hyperthermia
    caused by these <span id="alkaloids">tropane alkaloids</span> or for another reason such as 
    increased sensitivity and annoyance by fabric on the skin is unknown.
</p>
<a href="#HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</a>
<a href="#alkaloids">alkaloids</a>
<a href="#berserkers">Berserkers</a>

<p>
    Finally, the ingestion of <span id="alkaloids">anticholinergic tropane alkaloids</span> is 
    sometimes associated with a drop in blood pressure (Brown and Laiken,
    2011). Though this may also occur in <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span> poisonings, increased
    blood pressure has also been recorded making the exact effects 
    questionable (Kirchmair et al., 2012; Waser, 1967). With significant
    lowering of blood pressure, the individual would bleed less readily, and
    this may perhaps be the basis for the notion that swords were unable to
    harm the <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> (Arima et al., 2012; Castaneda et al., 2000; Durmus
    et al., 2007; Hasegawa et al., 2003; Stern et al., 1993). Though 
    obviously inflated with time, perhaps their surprisingly small amount of
    blood loss would have led to their enemies referring to them as immune
    to the blade, with the details later being lost through time. Indeed, the
    antihaemorrhagic properties of <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> were well enough known 
    towards the end of the time of the <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span> for them to be included in
    Avicenna's Canon of Medicine (Aziz et al., 2000). Though this arose far
    from the geographic range of the <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span>, it is entirely possible that
    they too were aware of this property of the plant and thus 
    consumed <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> for this reason. Similarly, their supposed immunity to fire may
    have simply referred to the pain dampening effects of the 
    anticholinergic <span id="alkaloids">alkaloids</span> 
    of <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span>. It is worth noting here that the closely
    related Mandragora with its similar alkaloid composition has been 
    implicated as the plant of Greek myth that the sorceress Medea used to
    make Jason immune to fire in his quest for the golden fleece (Harris,
    1916). These, however, are by far the most speculative of the symptoms
    here discussed, and are not strong indicators of the viability of this
    theory. Such a drop in blood pressure, for example, would also likely
    cause weakness that would be undesirable in battle.

<p>
    Some symptoms of the <span id="berserkers">berserkers</span>, however, cannot be well 
    explained in the context of <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> or <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> 
    poisoning. The chattering of teeth they were said to experience may 
    perhaps have been a result of muscle spasms arising from the use of either
    substance, though when taken into account that they were also said to
    experience chills in the body, perhaps they were simply cold and 
    shivering, which would be unsurprising if they were to walk around
    without much clothing on in cold northern climates. This, however,
    goes in direct contrast to the hyperthermia that both of these 
    intoxicants cause. Likewise, their shield biting may have simply been an
    attempt to stop chattering teeth when cold. It is possible that the odd
    array of symptoms may represent the use of <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> in conjunction with
    another substance (perhaps even <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">A. muscaria</span>) rather than simply
    <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> alone, however there is not enough historical, 
    archaeological, or modern pharmaceutical evidence to substantiate this.
    Either way, this constellation of symptoms is difficult to explain in any
    manner and all theories for this are guesses at best.

<h2>
    Conclusions
</h2>

<p>
    The present article has been able to provide a theory: that
    <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">Hyoscyamus niger</span> was used by the famed <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> warriors of the Saga
    period (870–1030 CE) in <span id="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</span> to produce their battle <span id="trance">trances</span>.
    Ultimately, future finds will determine if this theory will be proven or
    disproven. The most reliable form of archaeological/historical data
    combines paleobotanical and textual/artifactual information in order to
    provide a complete picture of the past (Merlin, 2003). The present 
    investigation has done just this, showing that at present the data available
    supports the potential use of <span id="HyoscyamusNiger">H. niger</span> as an intoxicating agent to induce
    the <span id="berserkers">berserker</span> <span id="trance">trance</span>. Though <span id="AmanitaMuscaria">Amanita muscaria</span> is a popular theoretical
    cause accepted by many, we have seen here that the symptomology of

    This article must of necessity conclude with the remark that I myself
    am neither a historian of nor an archaeologist of the Nordic region. As
    an ethnobotanist studying the use of anticholinergic solanaceous plants
    in Europe, however, this theory came to me as a result of the 
    information present in the literature. Only future research may now
    confirm or deny the speculative ethnobotanical perspective here presented.
