<h1>Coercion and Intimidation of Child Soldiers to Participate in Violence</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h1>
<p>Thousands of children under the age of 18 currently participate in armed conflicts in at least 18
countries worldwide, as part of government armies, paramilitaries, and armed opposition
groups. Since <span id="1994">1994</span>, <span id="Human Rights Watch">Human Rights Watch</span> has reported on the use and recruitment of child
soldiers in 15 countries. Both girls and boys are used as child soldiers. They serve as porters or
cooks, guards, messengers or spies. Many are pressed into combat, where they may be forced to
the front lines or sent into minefields ahead of older troops. Children have also been used for
suicide missions. In some conflicts, girls are raped, or given to military commanders as "wives."</p>

<p>Because children are often physically vulnerable, easily intimidated, and susceptible to
psychological manipulation, they typically make obedient soldiers. As part of their training for
violence, child recruits are often subject to grueling physical tasks as well as ideological
indoctrination. Children accused of the slightest infractions may be subject to extreme physical
punishments including beating, whipping, caning, and being chained or tied up with rope for
days at a time. In some conflicts, commanders supply child soldiers with <span id="Marijuana">marijuana</span> and <span id="Opiates">opiates</span>
to make them "brave" and lessen their fear of combat. Furthermore, commanders may initiate
child recruits by forcing them to witness or commit abuses and killings in order to desensitize
them to violence. Some children are forced to take part in atrocities against their own families
and neighbors to stigmatize them and ensure that they are unable to return to their
communities.</p>

<p>Many child soldiers are compelled to follow these orders under threat of severe punishment or
death. To coerce children to participate in combat and commit atrocities against civilians,
commanders not only use threats of violence against child recruits but also against their families
as well as the possibility of torture and death at the hands of the enemy. <span id="Human Rights Watch">Human Rights Watch</span>
investigations have also found that child recruits are often forced to physically punish and kill
other soldiers, including children, accused of desertion and other crimes. Child soldiers who
refuse to comply with orders may be severely beaten or threatened with execution. These
practices instill fear and guilt in the children and forewarn them of their fate should they
attempt to escape or fail to heed orders.</p>
<p>The use or threat of violence to compel child recruits to kill and torture other fighters and to
commit human rights violations against civilians is geographically widespread and common to
government armies, paramilitaries, and armed opposition groups. <span id="Human Rights Watch">Human Rights Watch</span> has
collected testimony to this effect in its investigations in <span class="location" id="Africa">Africa</span>, <span class="location" id="Asia">Asia</span> and the <span class="location" id="Americas">Americas</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="location" id="Angola">Angola</span></h2>
<p>Children recruited by the <span id="UNITA">National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)</span> faced
harsh discipline for infractions and especially severe penalties for attempting to escape. To deter
desertion, commanders forced child recruits to watch and participate in the execution of
captured escapees. Children demobilized from <span id="UNITA">UNITA</span> forces in <span id="1996">1996</span> explained that when one
child who had escaped was captured, the others would have to assist in his execution even if that
person were a family member.</p>

<h2><span class="location" id="Burma">Burma</span></h2>
<p><span class="location" id="Burma">Burma</span> has recruited tens of thousands of boys into its national army, typically by force, coercion
or intimidation. Boys are often told that if they refuse to join the army, they will be forced to go
to jail. Deliberately cut off from contact with their families, they are treated brutally by their
superiors and often prevented from fraternizing even among themselves. After training they are
sent off to distant battalions, where they are further brutalized by their commanders and taught
to view the local population as their enemy.</p>
<p>When a recruit is captured attempting to escape there is a standard punishment that seems
common to most of <span class="location" id="Burma">Burma</span>'s training schools and has not changed in the last 10 years: the
trainee is paraded in front of his entire training company, who are then forced to line up and take
turns hitting him hard once or twice with a stick while officers or other trainees pin him down
and look on.</p>

<p>Sai Seng described his experience of this in 2005, when he was 17:</p>

<blockquote><i>Only one person was caught. All 249 people had to beat him on the buttocks and the back
of his thighs with a green bamboo. I felt pity on my friend so I hit him lightly, and the <span id="NCO">NCO</span>
came and said, "Don't hit like that, hit like this" and hit me, and then made me hit my friend
again. Three sections [150 recruits] had already beaten him by then, and he was crying. The
<span id="NCO">NCO</span> was pinning his arms down with his back to me, so I couldn't see his face, he was face
down with his legs in the stocks. He was bloody because sometimes the sticks broke when
they hit him. After the beating the <span id="NCO">NCO</span>s carried him to the barracks with his legs still in
the stocks, and laid him on the cement floor without a mat. He died that night. His name
was <span id="Thet Naing Soe">Thet Naing Soe</span>, he was 18. After that the <span id="NCO">NCO</span>s said, "If you run away we'll do the same
to you."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>After a while the soldiers couldn't bear it anymore and they ran away. When people ran
away, if they recaptured them we students had to beat them. There were 200 people in our
group, and every one of us was ordered to hit him one time with a cane stick. If we said
anything they hit us. The reason is for us to know that if we run away later we will get
beaten like that too. After the beating, if he couldn't stand up anymore he was just left
laying on the concrete like that. Sometimes they were unconscious.</i></blockquote>
<p>Child recruits sent to their first combat operation were often so afraid that they were unable to
use their weapon or attempted to retreat. Fear of beatings or death at the hands of their
commanders prevented them from escaping.</p>
<p><span id="Khin Maung Than">Khin Maung Than</span> was 12 years old when he was first deployed into combat:</p>
<blockquote><i>I was afraid that first time. The section leader ordered us to take cover and open fire. There
were seven of us, and seven or ten of the enemy. I was too afraid to look, so I put my face in
the ground and shot my gun up at the sky. I was afraid their bullets would hit my head. I
fired two magazines, about forty rounds. I was afraid that if I didn't fire the section leader
would punish me.</i></blockquote>
<a href="#Khin Maung Than">Khin Maung Than</a>

<p><span id="Aung Zaw">Aung Zaw</span>'s commander threatened to kill him if he attempted to retreat during his first combat
exposure:</p>

<a href="#Aung Zaw">Aung Zaw</a>

<blockquote><i>I can't remember how old I was the first time in fighting. About 13. That time we walked
into a <span id="Karenni">Karenni</span> ambush, and four of our soldiers died. I was afraid because I was very young
so I tried to run back, but [the captain] shouted, "Don't run back! If you run back I'll shoot
you myself!"</i></blockquote>
<a href="#Karenni">Karenni</a>


<p>Child recruits interviewed by <span id="Human Rights Watch">Human Rights Watch</span> reported being forced to participate in
human rights violations against civilians, including forced labor, beatings and summary
executions. Forced to carry heavy loads of ammunition and other supplies, the civilians often
have trouble keeping up with the army column. The rank and file soldiers in charge of them,
afraid of the beatings and other punishments they face if they fall behind, become desperate and
try to do whatever is necessary to keep the porters moving. <span id="Thein Oo">Thein Oo</span> often saw villagers beaten
by his commanders during forced labor; "I didn't like it but I was afraid of my commander. If I
protested I'd be beaten by my commander, 2 <span id="Lieutenant Kyaw Myint Thein">Lieutenant Kyaw Myint Thein</span>."</p>

<p>Child soldiers are also compelled to take part in the destruction of villages in areas where the
army is pursuing a scorched earth policy. From the time of his recruitment at age thirteen in <span id="1995">1995</span>
until he fled the army in late <span id="2001">2001</span>, <span id="Moe Shwe">Moe Shwe</span> says, "I saw it twelve times. There were some <span id="Karen">Karen</span>
soldiers in the village, or if there's a battle near a village we burned the village." When asked if he
actually torched houses himself, he answered, "Yes, three times. About two or three houses each
time. We had to do it. We were ordered. If not they'd punch me. I felt very sorry and unhappy,
because I thought that if my house were burned like this there would be a lot of problems for my
family and me."</p>

<p>As part of their training, children recruited by the <span id="FARC-EP">Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC-EP)</span> and paramilitary forces in <span class="location" id="Colombia">Colombia</span> have been asked to kill captured enemy soldiers
as well as other child recruits, including friends, to prove their loyalty. <span id="Bernardo">Bernardo</span>, who joined

<blockquote><i>They give you a gun and you have to kill the best friend you have. They do it to see if they
can trust you. If you don't kill him, your friend will be ordered to kill you. I had to do it
because otherwise I would have been killed.</i></blockquote>
<p>Seventeen-year-old <span id="Adolfo">Adolfo</span>, also recruited by paramilitaries, described his initiation:</p>
<blockquote><i>I was really scared at first. The first test they give you is to kill a man, a guerrilla. Bring me
so and so, they say, so that he can learn. And they bring you and tell you to kill the man. If
you don't kill him, they will kill you. They used to bring guerrillas captured in <span class="location" id="Caquetá">Caquetá</span> to
the camp, and tie them up by the hands and legs and a man would come up with a
chainsaw, and slice them piece by piece. Everybody could watch. I must have seen it ten
times. It's part of the training.</i></blockquote>
<a href="#Adolfo">Adolfo</a>
<a href="#Caquetá">Caquetá</a>



<p>Fellow combatants who desert or are accused of infractions are treated harshly. Child recruits
are expected to watch and often to participate in such punishments. <span id="Mauricio">Mauricio</span> had been in the
<span id="FARC-EP">FARC-EP</span> for four years and had won a command without killing anybody. Then he was sent to
find and bring back a deserter who had been spotted in town by the militia:</p>
<a href="#Mauricio">Mauricio</a>
<a href="#FARC-EP">FARC-EP</a>


<blockquote><i>We went to his house and picked up him, then brought him back to the camp. There, they
held a war council. He had a defender, but everyone knew what the verdict was going to be.
It was automatic. There was no real possibility that he would escape shooting. His crimes
were "theft from the movement and desertion," the most serious crimes of all. In the war
council, no one voted to save him. After the council, we went and dug his grave. Then we
brought him to the side of the grave. He closed his eyes, and I shot him in the head. I had
never executed anyone before, but this time I had to do it. If you don't do it, they'll kill you.</i></blockquote>
<p>Children recruited by paramilitary and guerilla groups are trained to treat their enemy's fighters
and sympathizers without mercy. As a result children witness and participate in grave violations
of human rights including torture and killings. Commanders often use these instances to initiate
and implicate children in violence. Many child soldiers expressed fear of being executed if they
did not comply with orders.</p>
<p>At 13, <span id="Laidy">Laidy</span>, recruited by paramilitary forces, shot a policeman in the head. "I felt happy
afterwards. I wanted to please the commanders. Because if you say no, they'll kill you."</p>
<p>Separated from their families and believing they will never be released or escape, many child
recruits believe they have no choice but to prove their loyalty to their commanders and fellow
combatants by participating in killings and other grave abuses.</p>

<p>Many children were recruited into armed groups and government forces during the conflict in
<span class="location" id="Liberia">Liberia</span>. Some children saw their parents killed and believed they had no options but to join
armed groups for safety or survival. Some were forcibly recruited. Some joined because of
starvation so they would be fed by a warring faction. <span id="Human Rights Watch">Human Rights Watch</span> received testimony
that both rebel and government affiliated forces including the <span id="NPFL">National Patriotic Front of Liberia

<blockquote><i>They treated me very bad. They didn't take care of me. They beat me with a cartridge belt if
I put my gun down.</i></blockquote>
<p>The treatment of child soldiers was described by a social worker as follows:</p>
<blockquote><i>The kids got very harsh treatment. First of all, boys from both factions have told us that
there were initiation procedures when they joined in which they were forced to kill or rape
someone or perform some other atrocity, like throwing someone down a well, or into a
river. This was supposed to demonstrate that they were brave enough to be soldiers.
Anyway, they were told that they would be shot if they didn't do it.</p>
<p>Then many of them have told us that they were beaten if they spoke up and were
threatened with torture as punishment for doing something they weren't supposed to do. It
was not just <span id="NPFL">NPFL</span> and <span id="ULIMO">ULIMO</span> that beat the kids; <span id="ECOMOG">ECOMOG</span> and the <span id="AFL">AFL</span> beat kids
severely, too, sometimes causing head or other injuries.</i></blockquote>

<p>A counselor working with child soldiers also discussed their treatment by commanders:</p>
<blockquote><i>The factions use a kind of torture called "tabay," in which a person's elbows are tied
together behind his back, and the rope is pulled tighter and tighter until his rib cage
separates. This was a form of punishment that was used with child soldiers, too.</p>
<p>Kids have told us that they were actually forced to witness the execution of members of
their family or their friends. If they screamed or cried, they were killed. Boys have told us of
being lined up to watch executions and being forced to applaud. If you didn't applaud, you
could be next.</i></blockquote>
<p>One child-care worker reported:</p>
<blockquote><i>Some children were the most vicious, brutal fighters of all. I once saw a nine-year-old kill
someone at a check-point. Children learn by imitation; they saw killings and then when
their commanding officers ordered them to kill, they did. Some of the kids killed out of
fear; they were told they would be killed if they didn't carry out orders to kill.</i></blockquote>

<p>Child abductees in the <span id="LRA">Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)</span> are forced to beat and sometimes kill
civilians in looting operations, participate in the abduction of new children, and steal from and
burn houses in their home regions. Children are forced to witness and to participate in the
killings of other children, usually those who attempt to escape and are captured. The practice of
using the children to collectively kill fosters guilt and fear among them, and sends a powerful
message to the children of their potential fate if they attempt to escape. In addition, the brutal
tactics used to control children make their personal rehabilitation and reintegration into their

<blockquote><i>One boy tried to escape, but he was caught. They made him eat a mouthful of red pepper,
and five people were beating him. His hands were tied, and then they made us, the other
new captives, kill him with a stick. I felt sick. I knew this boy from before. We were from
the same village. I refused to kill him and they told me they would shoot me. They pointed
a gun at me, so I had to do it. The boy was asking me, "Why are you doing this?" I said I had
no choice. After we killed him, they made us smear his blood on our arms. I felt dizzy.
There was another dead body nearby, and I could smell the body. I felt so sick. They said we
had to do this so we would not fear death and so we would not try to escape.</p>
<p>I feel so bad about the things that I did ... It disturbs me so much--that I inflicted death on
other people ... When I go home I must do some traditional rites because I have killed. I
must perform these rites and cleanse myself. I still dream about the boy from my village
who I killed. I see him in my dreams, and he is talking to me and saying I killed him for
nothing, and I am crying.</i></blockquote>
<p>In combat operations many child soldiers who expressed fear or reservation were beaten by their
commanders into pressing ahead to the front lines. Even children without weapons were sent
forward to engage the enemy. Former child recruits witnessed large numbers of children killed
in such actions. <span id="Timothy">Timothy</span>, a 14 year old captured by the <span id="LRA">LRA</span>, recounted his experience in <span class="location" id="Sudan">Sudan</span>:</p>

<blockquote><i>I was good at shooting. I went for several battles in <span class="location" id="Sudan">Sudan</span>. The soldiers on the other side
would be squatting, but we would stand in a straight line. The commanders were behind us.
They would tell us to run straight into gunfire. The commanders would stay behind and
would beat those of us who would not run forward. You would just run forward shooting
your gun. I don't know if I actually killed any people, because you really can't tell if you're
shooting people or not. I might have killed people in the course of the fighting . . . . I
remember the first time I was in the front line. The other side started firing, and the
commander ordered us to run towards the bullets. I panicked. I saw others falling down
dead around me. The commanders were beating us for not running, for trying to crouch
down. They said if we fall down, we would be shot and killed by the soldiers.</p>

<blockquote><i>After training in <span class="location" id="Sudan">Sudan</span>, the rebels sent me back to <span class="location" id="Uganda">Uganda</span>. I was to be part of a group that
would attack trading centers in <span id="Kitgum">Kitgum</span> and abduct new children. I was well-armed, a
soldier already. As we were returning, we were attacked by government soldiers. The
frontline was somewhere ahead of where I was, and the commander said, "Run, run to the
front-line!" It didn't matter whether you had a gun or not. If you did not run they would
beat you with sticks. Many children without guns had to run to the front.</p>
<p>You are not allowed to appear to be thinking too much. If you had a gun, you had to be
firing all the time or you would be killed. And you were not allowed to take cover. The
order from the Holy Spirit was not to take cover. You must have no fear, and stand up as
you run into fire. This was because they said you would be protected by the Holy Spirit if
you stood tall and had no fear. But if you took cover, the Holy Spirit would be angry and
you would be shot dead by all the bullets.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For many child soldiers, carrying out violent acts against other fighters or civilians is an
inescapable part of their experience. Even though some children initially "volunteer" to serve as
soldiers, they quickly learn that the penalties for leaving their group are severe, and may include
death. They realize that they are at the mercy of their commanders, and do what they believe
they must in order to survive. Children who engage in violence often believe they have no choice
but to follow orders, particularly if they have witnessed other children killed for disobedience, or
have been beaten or threatened themselves.</p>
<p>For children who eventually leave these armed forces and groups, rehabilitation and
reintegration into their home communities can be extremely difficult. They may be stigmatized
as a former child soldier, be rejected by family and communities members for acts that they have
committed as a fighter, and in some instances, be subject to reprisals for their actions or group
affiliation. They often have no marketable job skills, may be vulnerable to re-recruitment as a
child soldier, or turn to a life of crime. Sustained support is essential to help them successfully
reintegrate into their home communities. This includes access to educational and vocational
training programs, reuniting the child with family or extended family members where possible,
and in some cases, participating in restorative justice processes to help the child acknowledge
their actions and gain reacceptance by the community.</p>
