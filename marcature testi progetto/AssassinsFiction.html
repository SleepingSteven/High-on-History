<p>Perhaps no other group from the <span id="MiddleAges">Middle Ages</span> has 
    sparked modern-day imaginations like the <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span>. 
    Viewed as mystical and deadly, they were said to be led 
    in <span id="Syria">Syria</span> by a charismatic figure known 
    as the <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span>.
    What can we really know about them?</p>

<p>The defining narrative in medieval times about the myth of 
    the <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span> (Shaykh al-Jabal) is that of 
    <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span>, which was written down in the early fouthteenth century. The account consists of legendary and 
    folkloric material that had been spread across the Middle 
    East and Europe by Sunni Muslims, <span id="Crusaders">Crusaders</span>, and Jewish, Christian, and Muslim travellers who visited <span id="Syria">Syria</span>, 
    <span id="Egypt">Egypt</span>, the <span id="HolyLand">Holy Land</span>, and <span id="Iran">Iran</span> from the twelfth century onwards. Marco Polo’s account remained the definitive one for 
    many centuries. He does not name the geographical location of 
    the territory of the <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span> – he just names it 
    as a country of Mulahet, which he says means ‘heretics’ according to the law of the Saracens. Here 
    is a typical passage from <span id="MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</span>’s account:</p>

<p class="quote">"The <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man</span> was called in their language <span id="Alaedin">Alaedin</span>… 
    He had made in a valley between two 
    mountains the biggest and most beautiful garden that was ever seen… There were ladies 
    there and damsels, the loveliest in the 
    world, unrivalled at playing every sort 
    of instrument and at singing and 
    dancing. And he gave his men 
    to understand that this garden 
    was Paradise… No-one ever 
    entered the garden except 
    those who he wished to make 
    <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span>... The <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man</span> kept 
    with him at his court all the youths from 
    12 to 20… He used to put some of these 
    youths in this Paradise four at a time, or 
    ten, or twenty… He gave them draughts 
    that sent them to sleep on the spot. Then 
    he had them taken and put in the garden, 
    where they were wakened. When they 
    awoke and found themselves in there… 
    they believed they were really in Paradise... 
    He entices them in a strange manner with such hopes and with promises 
    of such pleasures with eternal enjoyment 
    that they prefer rather to die than to live. 
    Many of them, even when standing on 
    a wall, will jump off at his nod or command, and, shattering their skulls, die a 
    miserable death."</p>

<p>We have several other medieval accounts – 
    including those by <span id="BenjaminTudela">Benjamin of Tudela</span>, <span id="BurchardStrasbourg">Burchard of Strasbourg</span>, 
    <span id="ArnoldLübeck">Arnold of Lübeck</span>, and 
    <span id="GregoryBarHebraeus">Gregory Bar Hebraeus</span> – that offer similar 
    stories: this <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span> was 
    a mysterious figure who commanded the 
    black arts of magic. His followers were said 
    to follow no laws, to abuse women, and to 
    eat the flesh of swine. The pejorative name 
    that they were given, first by Sunni Muslims and then by the <span id="Crusaders">Crusaders</span>, was hashishiyyun; 
    it came to mean ‘those who consume <span id="hashish">hashish</span>’. 
    In English this word would 
    evolve to become <span id="Assassins">assassins</span>.</p>

<h2>Origins of the Nizaris</h2>

<p>The actual history of the people that would be 
    called <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span> begins in <span id="Egypt">Egypt</span> in the last years 
    of the eleventh century. At that time, <span id="Egypt">Egypt</span> was 
    ruled by the Fatimid dynasty, who followed 
    Isma’ilism, a branch of Shia Islam. In 1094 the 
    Fatimid Caliph <span id="ImamAl-Mustansir">Imam Al-Mustansir bi’llah</span> died. 
    Although the caliph had wanted his eldest son 
    <span id="AbuMansurNizar">Abu Mansur Nizar</span> to succeed him, the vizier 
    engineered a palace coup to enthrone a much 
    younger son who could be more easily controlled. Nizar and his supporters were able to 
    raise an army to fight for the caliphate, but in 
    1095 they were defeated in battle. Nizar was 
    captured, taken to Cairo, and executed.</p>

    <a href="#ImamAl-Mustansir">Imam Al-Mustansir bi’llah</a>
    <a href="#AbuMansurNizar">Abu Mansur Nizar</a>

<p>However, Nizar’s followers would not accept the new Fatimid ruler, and they pledged 
    allegiance to Nizar's son <span id="Al-HadiNizar">Al-Hadi ibn Nizar</span>. 
    They would leave <span id="Egypt">Egypt</span> and go to Alamut, a 
    remote fortress in northern <span id="Iran">Iran</span>, under the 
    leadership of <span id="HasanSabbah">Hasan-i Sabbah</span>, northern <span id="Iran">Iran</span>, 
    where they set up their own state. Henceforth 
    they adopted the name Nizaris.</p>

<p><span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> missionaries from <span id="Iran">Iran</span> began to 
    infiltrate <span id="Syria">Syria</span> from the early 1100s onwards. 
    They tried to spread their message in the 
    key cities of Aleppo and Damascus, hoping 
    to gain the support of the many other Shia 
    communities in the region. After unsuccessful attempts to seize power in these cities, 
    the <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> in <span id="Syria">Syria</span> withdrew in the 1130s to 
    the relative safety of the mountains, heading 
    for the area between Lattakieh and Hama. 
    There the Syrian <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> displayed a remarkable ability to adapt to a difficult, and indeed 
    hostile, environment, and to survive in it as a 
    hated and beleaguered minority. They were 
    helped, of course, by the fragmentation and 
    weakness of <span id="Syria">Syria</span> in the years following the 
    <span id="FirstCrusade">First Crusade</span>, a situation that lasted until the 
    revitalization of the area under the strong 
    rule of the two great twelfth-century ‘counter-crusade’ leaders, <span id="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span> 
    and <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>.</p>

<p>Just as the <span id="Crusaders">Crusaders</span> in Outremer survived as minorities in the Sunni Muslim-majority
    areas of <span id="Egypt">Egypt</span>, <span id="Syria">Syria</span>, 
    and the <span id="HolyLand">Holy Land</span>, 
    so too the Syrian <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> within a few decades 
    adopted the strategy of occupying existing 
    castles or obtaining new ones in under-populated northern <span id="Syria">Syria</span> – castles such as Qadmus (1132-3), al-Kahf (1135-6), and, above 
    all, Masyaf (1140). It is hard to know how 
    many castles they controlled – one historian 
    suggests twenty-four, while another believes it was about seventy. Many of these fortifications 
    were very close together, forming a virtually 
    impregnable zone. Small wonder that the Syrian <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> were able to exercise a political 
    influence out of all proportion to their size.</p>

<h2><span id="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</span></h2>

<p>After an early period of establishing a firm 
    foothold in the mountains of Northern <span id="Syria">Syria</span> 
    far from their mother centre in <span id="Iran">Iran</span>, the Syrian 
    <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> acquired their most famous and longruling leader, <span id="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</span>, the Shaykh 
    al-Jabal, the <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span> – a title 
    that suggests both noble stock and an aura of 
    mystery. He took over the leadership at Masyaf 
    in 1169, ruling there for thirty years. He found 
    himself in conflict, not only with three Crusader 
    states, but also with the strong Sunni Muslim 
    military barons <span id="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span> and <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>.</p>

    <a href="#Nizari">Nizari</a>

<p>We know a few details about <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span>. 
    He was born in Basra and worked as a 
    school teacher before becoming a missionary. He was sent from <span id="Iran">Iran</span> to <span id="Syria">Syria</span> in 1162, but took no leadership for seven years. He 
    would go on to rule the Syrian <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> community until his death in 1193; during his 
    time in power he had acted independently 
    of the <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> based in <span id="Iran">Iran</span>.</p>

    <a href="#RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</a>
    <a href="#Nizari">Nizari</a>


<p>We have only one account that tells 
    the story of <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span>’s life from the <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> point 
    of view. It was written in 1324 by a Syrian 
    <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> scholar named <span id="AbuFiras">Abu Firas</span> and is called 
    The splendid exploits of <span id="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</span>. 
    This account, not surprisingly, is hagiographical, full of legendary anecdotes about <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span>, 
    but it also provides factual information corroborated by the chronicles of medieval Sunni Muslim, anti-<span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> writers. The work is a 
    fascinating source but it should be used with 
    great caution. One passage from it is, however, especially significant:</p>
    <a href="#RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</a>
    <a href="#AbuFiras">Abu Firas</a>
    <a href="#Nizari">Nizari</a>


<p class="quote">Many common ignorant fools think that it 
    is thanks to his knowledge of magic that 
    the Lord <span id="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din</span> practiced these 
    marvels. Well, he confounded them all 
    and reduced them to silence, not by science or magic but by the force of truth 
    and conviction, by his demonstrations 
    and by the quotations which he pronounced from Qur’anic verses.</p>
    <a href="#RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</a>

<p>In the context of the many hagiographical 
    episodes that <span id="AbuFiras">Abu Firas</span> recounts in the biography of his hero, 
    this picture of his religious 
    credentials has a convincing ring to it.</p>
    <a href="#AbuFiras">Abu Firas</a>

<p>Within his community <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> seems 
    to have organised his followers with great 
    skill. The account of <span id="AbuFiras">Abu Firas</span> describes 
    him as possessing extraordinary powers, 
    such as clairvoyance, prophecy, and telepathy. He did not need a personal bodyguard, 
    ruling by the force of his character 
    alone and inspiring devotion and fear alike 
    among his subjects. He was a man of few 
    words, preferring instead to assume grand 
    poses. He was, for example, never seen 
    eating, and he cast no reflection in water. 
    There are dozens of chapters devoted 
    to his seemingly miraculous exploits, 
    whether these be escaping assassination attempts against 
    himself or being able 
    to reply to letters before they 
    were even delivered.</p>
    <a href="#RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</a>
    <a href="#AbuFiras">Abu Firas</a>

<p>From the very beginning of his residence 
    in Masyaf, <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> is depicted by <span id="AbuFiras">Abu Firas</span> 
    as a mysterious, eccentric personage. 
    He arrived in <span id="Syria">Syria</span> riding on a white 
    donkey and wearing a headdress of 
    striped Yemeni wool and shoes he 
    had sewn himself. He did not announce himself as the new head 
    of the Syrian Nizaris, preferring 
    instead to await the death of the 
    current incumbent. He would 
    remain motionless for hours, 
    with his lips mysteriously 
    moving but with no sound 
    coming out of them. However, despite this portrayal of him, <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> had 
    his feet firmly on the ground; for example, he 
    positioned pigeon towers on mountaintops 
    from which to send messages to the other 
    citadels he governed. Clearly, then, he was 
    a most formidable charismatic personality, 
    and his actions would show him to be a worthy adversary in the struggle for power in the 
    medieval Middle East.</p>
    <a href="#Syria">Syria</a>
    <a href="#RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</a>
    <a href="#AbuFiras">Abu Firas</a>

<p>It can be assumed with confidence that 
    the <span id="Crusaders">Crusaders</span> would not have had the slightest interest in <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> doctrine, 
    practice, and 
    proselytizing, whilst Sunni Muslims would 
    have dismissed their doctrinal details with 
    horror and contempt. Given the jihad-saturated atmosphere 
    of twelfth-century Muslim 
    writings, it is noteworthy that there is, it would eem, no mention of jihad in a <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> context. 
    The only allusion to such matters that 
    I have found so far are the words of an unknown <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> poet. Referring to the strategy 
    of killing high-profile victims, which achieved 
    maximum impact at minimal costs to the sect 
    – a policy that the Syrian <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> had brought 
    with them from <span id="Iran">Iran</span> and a policy that made 
    their name feared both in the Middle East and 
    in Europe – the unknown poet writes:</p>
    <a href="#Iran">Iran</a>
    <a href="#Nizari">Nizari</a>
    <a href="#Crusaders">Crusaders</a>


<p class="quote">By a single warrior on foot, a king may 
    be struck with terror, though he may own 
    more than 100,000 horsemen.</p>

<p>This interesting line of poetry may well be an 
    oblique allusion to the young men called fida’is, 
    trained to perform acts of political murder with 
    daggers as part of a strategy of intimidation.</p>

<div class="insert">

        <h3>Using Cover Tactics</h3>

        <p><span id="UsamaMunqidh">Usama ibn Munqidh</span>, the twelfth-century Syrian warrior and writer, noted that he fought 
            against the <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> Isma’ilis on a few occasions. He also recounted this event, which he said 
            happened in 1106, where this group used deception to capture the citadel at Apamea:
            A group of Isma’ilis from the populace of Apamea endeavoured to take possession of the 
            place. They hatched a plot whereby six of them, after having obtained a horse, a mule, some 
            Frankish gear, a shield, and a mail hauberk, went out from a region of Aleppo to Apamea with 
            all the gear and those animals.
            They said to <span id="IbnMula’ib">Ibn Mula’ib</span> (he was a generous and courageous man), ‘We came intending 
            to enter your service, and we encountered a Frankish knight and killed him. So we bring you 
            his horse, his mule, and his gear.’
            And so <span id="IbnMula’ib">Ibn Mula’ib</span> treated them with hospitality and bade them stay in the citadel of 
            Apamea in a suite of rooms adjoining the city wall. The Isma’ilis dug a hole in the wall and 
            set with the Apameans an appointed time… to strike. The Apameans climbed up through that 
            hole, killed <span id="IbnMula’ib">Ibn Mula’ib</span>, and took possession of the citadel of Apamea.</p>
            <a href="#UsamaMunqidh">Usama ibn Munqidh</a>

<h2>Against <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span></h2>

<p>It must be admitted that both Crusader and 
    Sunni Muslim chroniclers attribute almost 
    every murder of important figures to <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span>’s 
    fida’is (devoted followers). In a very short 
    space of time, their small group caused a degree of fear and paranoia quite out
    of proportion to their small numbers.
    Perhaps the most famous episodes concerning the <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> of <span id="Syria">Syria</span> 
    involve the rivalry between <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> and <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>. 
    <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s predecessor <span id="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span> had already tried to attack 
    <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span>’s territory and had had, according to 
    <span id="AbuFiras">Abu Firas</span>, the terrifying experience of finding a dagger on the ground near his head; 
    on it he saw the words, “If you do not leave 
    tomorrow night, this dagger will be stuck in 
    your belly”. But it was <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> who became 
    the target of the fiercest hostility, which took 
    the form of two attempts on his life soon after 
    he arrived in <span id="Syria">Syria</span> from Cairo late in 1174.</p>  
    <a href="#Syria">Syria</a>
    <a href="#Saladin">Saladin</a>
    <a href="#RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</a>
    <a href="#NurDin">Nur al-Din</a>
    <a href="#AbuFiras">Abu Firas</a>
    <a href="#Nizari">Nizari</a>

<p>Why should <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> have been attacked 
    by the <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> so soon after his seizure of 
    power in <span id="Syria">Syria</span>? In the tough power politics of 
    twelfth-century <span id="Syria">Syria</span>, the period immediately 
    after the death of <span id="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span> presented a very 
    good opportunity for <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> to attack <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>, 
    a threatening newcomer who was trying to 
    grab all the lands that had been carved out 
    as an empire by <span id="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span>. <span id="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span> had 
    died in 1174, having ruled for twenty-eight 
    years. In that time he had never managed to 
    achieve any great success against the Nizaris. 
    But clearly a new military leader in the form of 
    <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> coming from <span id="Egypt">Egypt</span> should be stopped before his power became consolidated. 
    <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> left <span id="Egypt">Egypt</span> and arrived in Damascus in November 1174, under the guise of protecting 
    the eleven-year-old son of <span id="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span> from his 
    threatening cousins in Mosul. <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> must have 
    feared for the survival of the <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> state in 
    <span id="Syria">Syria</span> when he saw the rising power of <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>; 
    this was truly a dangerous enemy.</p>

            <h3>An Early Chirstian and Jewish View</h3>

            <p>The earliest European 
                view of the <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span> 
                comes from Tractatus 
                de locis et statu sancte

                anonymous guide to the 
                lands of the Near East, 
                perhaps written by a 
                German cleric between 
                the years 1168 and 
                1187. The author offers a 
                somewhat positive view 
                of these people, comparing them to the Templars,

                They are drawn from the Jews, but 
                they do not observe the rites of the Jews 
                in all things. They are also men devout in 
                their superstition just as the Templars are 
                to their rule. They worship their leader as 
                a god and obey him to the death. When 
                their prince, who is always called the Old 
                Man, as if wise, wishes to kill any prince, 
                he names in the midst of their daggers the 
                one whom he wishes to kill. Then, competing among themselves, they run to their 
                daggers, and the one who is able to obtain it gives thanks to his prince 
                and immediately departs to kill the man named. 
                Whoever dies in obedience is worshipped 
                as an angel. Their life is communal. They 
                do not have property. Less than thirty cannot pass a judgment. They have a leader in 
                the Far East, who is the head of the order and of their religion. To him they submit 
                and him they obey. The Saracens call this 
                man the lord of the daggers. They conspire 
                against individual princes and this not 
                without fault or cause. It is the greatest dishonour for them to kill common people. 
                They have an alphabet made of Chaldean 
                and Hebrew letters.</p>

                called Al-Hashishim. They do not believe 
                in the religion of Islam, but follow one of 
                their own folk, whom they regard as their

<p>The first assassination attempt on <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> took place outside the walls of Aleppo 
    early in 1175. It is not clear from the sources who instigated this attack. Was the family 
    of <span id="NurDin">Nur al-Din</span>, whose territories <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> was 
    bent on capturing, involved in this? Or the 
    governor of Aleppo, Gümüshtegin? Had one 
    of these two parties got in touch with <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span>? 
    Or was it <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> alone? The Sunni Muslim 
    chronicler <span id="IbnJawzi">Ibn al-Jawzi</span> suggests that the attempts on <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s life were the result of his 
    aggression against <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> villages in 1174-5. Whatever the truth, <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> escaped unharmed on this occasion. Quite possibly, it 
    was a united initiative from all three parties 
    who saw <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> as a dangerous foe, interfering in Syrian affairs.</p>

<p>The second attempt on <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s life 
    took place in 1176; it was a much more terrifying incident and it seems likely to have 
    come from <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> alone. The following account comes from the chronicle of the Ayyubid 
    dynasty by <span id="IbnWasil">Ibn Wasil</span>. During the siege 
    of Azaz, <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> was attacked whilst in a tent 
    one night reviewing some troops and raising 
    their morale. Some Nizaris, wearing military 
    apparel, were in the group. One of them 
    leapt out of the line and struck <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s head 
    with a knife. Had it not been for his helmet 
    the sultan would have been killed. <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> 
    tried to stop further blows but he could not 
    prevent the assailant from striking him again 
    and again in his neck, which was, however, 
    protected by a chainmail collar. One of <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s 
    mamluks appeared and killed the assassin. That was not the end of the incident. 
    A second assassin appeared and killed <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s commander Da’ud before being struck 
    down himself. Two more <span id="Assassins">assassins</span> then came 
    forward; one was killed by <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s brother 
    and the fourth, fleeing from the tent, was torn 
    to pieces by the crowd.</p>

    <a id="#IbnWasil">Ibn Wasil</a>
    
<p><span id="IbnWasil">Ibn Wasil</span> continues his most unusually 
    long narrative of an assassination attempt 
    with the following graphic description:</p>
    <a id="#IbnWasil">Ibn Wasil</a>

<p class="quote">The sultan rode to his tent, terrified by 
    this event, with his blood flowing down 
    his cheek and the collar of his chainmail 
    wet. He hid himself away, took precautions and constructed around his tent 
    something resembling a palisade to cover it. He sat in a wooden house, on his 
    guard against the soldiery. Those whom 
    he did not like (the look of) he sent away 
    and those he recognized he allowed in.</p>

<p>It is well known that, despite the panegyrics of his biographers 
    and his heroic reputation in medieval Europe for generosity and 
    chivalric virtues, <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> was capable of 
    demonstrating great anger. The famous episode with <span id="ReynaldChatillon">Reynald of Chatillon</span> after Hattin 
    in <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>’s tent is just one example of his 
    passionate nature when roused by feelings 
    of personal vengeance. And what could be more personal than attacks on his own life? 
    So it is not surprising that he sought reprisals against the <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> by besieging their 
    centre of operations at Masyaf shortly after 
    the second attempt to kill him.</p>
    <a href="#Saladin">Saladin</a>
    <a href="#ReynaldChatillon">Reynald of Chatillon</a>
    <a href="#Nizari">Nizari</a>

<p>But <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> withdrew after only one 
    week of the siege, and thereafter neither he 
    nor <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> embarked on aggressive action 
    against the other for the rest of their lives. 
    They died within a few months of each other 
    in 1193. It does indeed seem probable that 
    they came to some kind of non-aggression 
    pact after Masyaf. After all, <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> had been 
    attacked in a terrifying manner on two occasions and was lucky to escape with his life. 
    He must have been very fearful of further 
    attempts to kill him. Thus the mighty <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span>, the public promoter of Sunni Islam and 
    the eradication of heresy, was cornered into 
    making a deal with the leader of the hated 
    <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> sect in <span id="Syria">Syria</span>.</p>

<h2>The murder of <span id="ConradMontferrat">Conrad of Montferrat</span></h2>

<p>There is another high-profile assassination 
    attempt that has been blamed on 
    <span id="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</span> and his followers: the 
    killing of <span id="ConradMontferrat">Conrad</span>, Marquis of Montferrat. 
    This Italian nobleman had come to the 
    Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187 and quickly 
    gained a reputation as a capable leader of 
    Crusader forces. He also used his political 
    connections to gain power in the kingdom, 
    and by 1190 he was the de facto king of 
    the Crusader state.</p>
    <a href="#RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</a>
    <a href="#ConradMontferrat">Conrad of Montferrat</a>

<p><span id="ConradMontferrat">Conrad</span> would find his share of enemies among the <span id="Crusaders">Crusaders</span>, including 
    the English king Richard I. In April 1192, 
    <span id="ConradMontferrat">Conrad</span> was elected the official king of 
    Jerusalem by the local barons, but before 
    he could take the throne, he was attacked 
    in the city of Tyre on 28 April 1192. The 
    Itinerarium Peregrinorum et Gesta Regis 
    Ricardi is one of several accounts that tells 
    the story of what happened to <span id="ConradMontferrat">Conrad</span>:</p>
    <a href="#ConradMontferrat">Conrad of Montferrat</a>
    <a href="#Crusaders">Crusaders</a>

<p class="quote">One day he had been given a friendly 
    invitation to dine with the Bishop of 
    Beauvais, and was returning peacefully 
    from the feast, absolutely cheerful and 
    good-humoured. He had reached the Toll-house when two young <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span>, 
    unencumbered by cloaks, rushed up to 
    him at great speed, stretched out the two 
    knives which they held in their hands and 
    stabbed him this way and that way in the 
    stomach, mortally wounding him, before 
    running off at full speed!</p>
    <a href="#Assassins">Assassins</a>

<p>The chronicler notes that as <span id="ConradMontferrat">Conrad</span> fell 
    dying from his horse, one of the attackers 
    was immediately killed, while the other 
    escaped to a nearby church. He was soon 
    dragged out, interrogated, and killed. This 
    second attacker confessed that he had 
    been sent by the <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span> to kill the Marquis, and that he and 
    his colleague had “been in the Marquis’ 
    service a long time, awaiting a suitable 
    moment to carry out the deed."</p>
    <a href="#OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</a>

<p>Accusations soon 
    emerged against <span id="KingRichard">King Richard</span>, believing that 
    he was the real mastermind of the plot. 
    Historians have also suggested 
    that other <span id="Crusaders">Crusade leaders</span> were responsible for 
    the assassination. Meanwhile, sources from the 
    Islamic world offer their 
    own version of events. 
    <span id="IbnAthir">Ibn al-Athir</span>, writing in the 
    early thirteenth century, 
    believed that it was <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> that orchestrated 
    the attack on <span id="ConradMontferrat">Conrad</span>. He offered <span id="RashidSinan">Sinan</span> money 
    to kill both the Marquis and <span id="KingRichard">King Richard</span>, but the <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> leader only acted to kill 
    <span id="ConradMontferrat">Conrad</span>, apparently concluding “that <span id="Saladin">Saladin</span> 
    should not have a mind untroubled by the 
    Franks, and thus be free to deal with them.”
    <span id="IbnAthir">Ibn al-Athir</span> then goes on to offer his 
    own account of the assassination:</p>

<p class="quote">He sent two men disguised as monks, 
    who became associated with the Lord 
    of Sidon and Balian’s son the Lord of 
    Ramla. They were both with the Marquis in Tyre. The two stayed with them 
    for six months, making a show of piety. 
    The Marquis became acquainted with 
    them and trusted them. On the above 
    date (28 April 1192) the Bishop at Tyre 
    gave a banquet for the Marquis. He attended, ate his food and drank his wine 
    and left. The two Batinis we have mentioned leapt on him and wounded 
    him severely. One of them fled 
    and entered a church to hide. 
    It chanced that the Marquis 
    was carried there to have 
    his wound bound. This assassin attacked and slew 
    him. Both Batinis were 
    killed in due course.</p>

            <h3>The Fall of the <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> in Persia</h3>

            <p>In the year 1238 an envoy arrived in Western 
                Europe from Islamic lands, said to be sent by 
                the <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</span> himself. He 
                went to the courts of the kings of France and 
                England, to warn them of a new threat from 
                the East - the Mongols. The envoy warned that 
                they must join forces now to face the Mongols, or otherwise both their lands would be 
                destroyed. A bishop overheard his plea to the 
                King of England, and then declared, “Let us 
                leave these dogs to devour one another, that 
                they may all be consumed and perish....”</p>
                <a href="#OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountain</a>

            <p>It would be Eastern Europe that would 
                be the first to suffer a Mongol invasion, but 
                a clash between the <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> and the Mongols 
                was seemingly inevitable. The heirs of 
                <span id="GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</span> were seeking to expand their 
                empire into the Middle East, and any challenge to their 
                control would not be tolerated. Moreover, several other Muslim states 
                in the region that had submitted to Mongol rule were calling on Mongke Khan to 
                destroy the group. When Mongke heard a 
                rumour that the <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> had sent 400 <span id="Assassins">assassins</span> to kill him, he expedited plans against 
                them, sending a huge army under his brother Hulagu to the Middle East.</p>

            <p>The Mongol invasion, which started 
                around 1253, would slowly conquer various 
                <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> castles, but eventually the <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> leader, 
                <span id="RuknKhwurshah">Rukn al-Din Khwurshah</span>, was forced to surrender. More fortresses then yielded, 
                while others attempted to hold off the Mongols. 
                By 1256 the entire region had been 
                conquered, and <span id="RuknKhwurshah">Khwurshah</span> along 
                with many of his people would be executed. <span id="Ata-MalikJuvayni">Ata-Malik Juvayni</span>, a Muslim 
                official who served Hulagu, wrote a

                what he himself took when he went 
                into the <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> castles:</p>

            <h3><span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> Castle Defences</h3>
            
            <p>As a threatened minority, the <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> were keen 
                to make sure they were protected from their 
                neighbours. This is best exemplified by the 
                system of fortifications they developed in both 
                northern Persia and <span id="Syria">Syria</span>. By one estimate they 
                controlled over 150 castles in these regions, 
                almost always in remote and mountainous areas. These castles would be built close enough 
                together that they could communicate and 
                defend each other. Moreover, the <span id="Nizari">Nizari</span> excavated extensive chambers, such as at Alamut, 
                for food, water and other supplies to be stored. 
                All of these measures made these fortifications 
                very difficult to besiege. The fortress of Girdkuh, for example, 
                was besieged by the Mongols with 5,000 men. It would take seventeen 
                years before it surrendered.</p>

<p>What emerges from reading the various sources is 
    that there is a jumble of 
    different versions of who 
    may have been involved in 
    the killing, somehow conspiring with  <span id="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</span> 
    for his followers to carry out the deed. 
    Meanwhile, the <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> themselves seemingly never responded to these accusations, 
    for it was in their interest to stay silent and 
    let their reputation as deadly foes spread 
    throughout the region.</p>
    <a href="#Nizari">Nizari</a>

<p><span id="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</span> would die in

    title of <span id="OldManMountain">Old Man of the Mountains</span>. Their 
    small state in the Syrian mountains would 
    last until the 1260s, finally being defeated

<p>Taking a look back at <span id="RashidSinan">Rashid al-Din Sinan</span> and his followers, 
    it is certainly difficult to discern fact from fiction. One must 
    keep in mind that the Syrian <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> were 
    just a tiny group that were trying to survive in their mountain strongholds, which 
    they achieved mostly through alliances and compromises with their neighbours. It was 
    more through diplomacy than warfare that 
    they endured. Their alleged use of murder 
    was exaggerated by their enemies, but this 
    was a notion they did not want to dispel, 
    for it helped to protect them. Those myths 
    around the <span id="Assassins">assassins</span> have endured long after their states were lost, but careful historical research can help to shed further light 
    on who they really were.</p>

            <h3>Assassins' Creed</h3>

            <p>The medieval European depiction of the <span id="Nizari">Nizaris</span> as fanatical and licentious has been 
                an enduring one. Their portrayals in popular media almost always cast them as villains, 
                but there is one notable exception to this: Assassin’s Creed.
                Released in 2007, Assassin’s Creed is a video game created by Ubisoft. The story involves 
                a modern-day man who is subjected to a machine that allows him to relive the actions of his 
                blood ancestors. He soon is taken back to the twelfth century, where he discovers that his 
                forebears were members of the <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span>, who have been fighting the evil Knights Templar 
                throughout time. The gameplay involves characters stealthily moving across cities and castles, 
                using almost superhuman powers. 
                The game has the <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span> as the protagonists, but downplays their religious elements. 
                Critically acclaimed, <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span>' Creed soon became an international hit, and has spawned 
                several sequels. The series of games has sold over a 100 million copies. The story has also 
                been adapted into novels, comic books and even a feature film. While the <span id="Assassins">Assassins</span> are still 
                portrayed as a mysterious and exotic group, they are at least presented as the ‘good guys’.</p>
