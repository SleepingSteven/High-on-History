                                <h2>Introduction</h1>
                                <p>Thousands of children under the age of 18 currently participate in armed conflicts in at least 18
                                countries worldwide, as part of government armies, paramilitaries, and armed opposition
                                groups. Since <span id="1994">1994</span>, <span id="#HumanRightsWatch">Human Rights Watch</span> has reported on the use and recruitment of child
                                soldiers in 15 countries. Both girls and boys are used as child soldiers. They serve as porters or
                                cooks, guards, messengers or spies. Many are pressed into combat, where they may be forced to
                                the front lines or sent into minefields ahead of older troops. Children have also been used for
                                suicide missions. In some conflicts, girls are raped, or given to military commanders as "wives."</p>
                                <a href="#1994">1994</a>
                                <a href="#HumanRightsWatch">Human Rights Watch</a>


                                <p>Because children are often physically vulnerable, easily intimidated, and susceptible to
                                psychological manipulation, they typically make obedient soldiers. As part of their training for
                                violence, child recruits are often subject to grueling physical tasks as well as ideological
                                indoctrination. Children accused of the slightest infractions may be subject to extreme physical
                                punishments including beating, whipping, caning, and being chained or tied up with rope for
                                days at a time. In some conflicts, commanders supply child soldiers with <span id="Marijuana">marijuana</span> and <span id="Opiates">opiates</span>
                                to make them "brave" and lessen their fear of combat. Furthermore, commanders may initiate
                                child recruits by forcing them to witness or commit abuses and killings in order to desensitize
                                them to violence. Some children are forced to take part in atrocities against their own families
                                and neighbors to stigmatize them and ensure that they are unable to return to their
                                communities.</p>

                                <a href="#Opiates">Opiates</a>


                                <p>Many child soldiers are compelled to follow these orders under threat of severe punishment or
                                death. To coerce children to participate in combat and commit atrocities against civilians,
                                commanders not only use threats of violence against child recruits but also against their families
                                as well as the possibility of torture and death at the hands of the enemy. <span id="#HumanRightsWatch">Human Rights Watch</span>
                                investigations have also found that child recruits are often forced to physically punish and kill
                                other soldiers, including children, accused of desertion and other crimes. Child soldiers who
                                refuse to comply with orders may be severely beaten or threatened with execution. These
                                practices instill fear and guilt in the children and forewarn them of their fate should they
                                attempt to escape or fail to heed orders.</p>
                                <p>The use or threat of violence to compel child recruits to kill and torture other fighters and to
                                commit human rights violations against civilians is geographically widespread and common to
                                government armies, paramilitaries, and armed opposition groups. <span id="#HumanRightsWatch">Human Rights Watch</span> has
                                collected testimony to this effect in its investigations in <span class="location" id="Africa">Africa</span>, <span class="location" id="Asia">Asia</span> and the <span class="location" id="Americas">Americas</span>.</p>

                                harsh discipline for infractions and especially severe penalties for attempting to escape. To deter
                                desertion, commanders forced child recruits to watch and participate in the execution of
                                captured escapees. Children demobilized from <span id="UNITA">UNITA</span> forces in <span id="1996">1996</span> explained that when one

                                superiors and often prevented from fraternizing even among themselves. After training they are
                                sent off to distant battalions, where they are further brutalized by their commanders and taught
                                to view the local population as their enemy.</p>

                                common to most of <span class="location" id="Burma">Burma</span>'s training schools and has not changed in the last 10 years: the
                                trainee is paraded in front of his entire training company, who are then forced to line up and take
                                turns hitting him hard once or twice with a stick while officers or other trainees pin him down
                                and look on.</p>

                                came and said, "Don't hit like that, hit like this" and hit me, and then made me hit my friend

                                down with his legs in the stocks. He was bloody because sometimes the sticks broke when
                                they hit him. After the beating the <span id="NCO">NCO</span>s carried him to the barracks with his legs still in
                                the stocks, and laid him on the cement floor without a mat. He died that night. His name

                                group, and every one of us was ordered to hit him one time with a cane stick. If we said
                                anything they hit us. The reason is for us to know that if we run away later we will get
                                beaten like that too. After the beating, if he couldn't stand up anymore he was just left

                                the ground and shot my gun up at the sky. I was afraid their bullets would hit my head. I
                                fired two magazines, about forty rounds. I was afraid that if I didn't fire the section leader

                                <p>Children recruited by paramilitary and guerilla groups are trained to treat their enemy's fighters

                                of human rights including torture and killings. Commanders often use these instances to initiate
                                and implicate children in violence. Many child soldiers expressed fear of being executed if they
                                did not comply with orders.</p>

                                <p>The treatment of child soldiers was described by a social worker as follows:</p>
                                <blockquote><i>The kids got very harsh treatment. First of all, boys from both factions have told us that
                                there were initiation procedures when they joined in which they were forced to kill or rape
                                someone or perform some other atrocity, like throwing someone down a well, or into a
                                river. This was supposed to demonstrate that they were brave enough to be soldiers.
                                Anyway, they were told that they would be shot if they didn't do it.</p>
                                <p>Then many of them have told us that they were beaten if they spoke up and were
                                threatened with torture as punishment for doing something they weren't supposed to do. It
                                was not just <span id="NPFL">NPFL</span> and <span id="ULIMO">ULIMO</span> that beat the kids; <span id="ECOMOG">ECOMOG</span> and the <span id="AFL">AFL</span> beat kids
                                severely, too, sometimes causing head or other injuries.</i></blockquote>

                                <p>A counselor working with child soldiers also discussed their treatment by commanders:</p>
                                <blockquote><i>The factions use a kind of torture called "tabay," in which a person's elbows are tied
                                together behind his back, and the rope is pulled tighter and tighter until his rib cage
                                separates. This was a form of punishment that was used with child soldiers, too.</p>
                                <p>Kids have told us that they were actually forced to witness the execution of members of
                                their family or their friends. If they screamed or cried, they were killed. Boys have told us of
                                being lined up to watch executions and being forced to applaud. If you didn't applaud, you
                                could be next.</i></blockquote>
                                <p>One child-care worker reported:</p>
                                <blockquote><i>Some children were the most vicious, brutal fighters of all. I once saw a nine-year-old kill
                                someone at a check-point. Children learn by imitation; they saw killings and then when
                                their commanding officers ordered them to kill, they did. Some of the kids killed out of
                                fear; they were told they would be killed if they didn't carry out orders to kill.</i></blockquote>

                                group, but he refused. He said he was then told to kill a captured <span id="AFL">AFL</span> soldier who was being
                                beaten. He refused. The <span id="INPFL">INPFL</span> fighters told him that he would be killed if he did not kill the
                                soldier. At knifepoint, he carried out the order.</p>

                                new captives, kill him with a stick. I felt sick. I knew this boy from before. We were from
                                the same village. I refused to kill him and they told me they would shoot me. They pointed
                                a gun at me, so I had to do it. The boy was asking me, "Why are you doing this?" I said I had
                                no choice. After we killed him, they made us smear his blood on our arms. I felt dizzy.
                                There was another dead body nearby, and I could smell the body. I felt so sick. They said we
                                had to do this so we would not fear death and so we would not try to escape.</p>

                                other people ... When I go home I must do some traditional rites because I have killed. I
                                must perform these rites and cleanse myself. I still dream about the boy from my village

                                <p>In combat operations many child soldiers who expressed fear or reservation were beaten by their
                                commanders into pressing ahead to the front lines. Even children without weapons were sent
                                forward to engage the enemy. Former child recruits witnessed large numbers of children killed
                                in such actions. <span id="Timothy">Timothy</span>, a 14 year old captured by the <span id="LRA">LRA</span>, recounted his experience in <span class="location" id="Sudan">Sudan</span>:</p>

                                They would tell us to run straight into gunfire. The commanders would stay behind and
                                would beat those of us who would not run forward. You would just run forward shooting

                                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                <p>For many child soldiers, carrying out violent acts against other fighters or civilians is an
                                inescapable part of their experience. Even though some children initially "volunteer" to serve as
                                soldiers, they quickly learn that the penalties for leaving their group are severe, and may include
                                death. They realize that they are at the mercy of their commanders, and do what they believe
                                they must in order to survive. Children who engage in violence often believe they have no choice
                                but to follow orders, particularly if they have witnessed other children killed for disobedience, or
                                have been beaten or threatened themselves.</p>
                                <p>For children who eventually leave these armed forces and groups, rehabilitation and
                                reintegration into their home communities can be extremely difficult. They may be stigmatized
                                as a former child soldier, be rejected by family and communities members for acts that they have
                                committed as a fighter, and in some instances, be subject to reprisals for their actions or group
                                affiliation. They often have no marketable job skills, may be vulnerable to re-recruitment as a
                                child soldier, or turn to a life of crime. Sustained support is essential to help them successfully
                                reintegrate into their home communities. This includes access to educational and vocational
                                training programs, reuniting the child with family or extended family members where possible,
                                and in some cases, participating in restorative justice processes to help the child acknowledge
                                their actions and gain reacceptance by the community.</p>

                                    <p>One perennial challenge of writing about illicit <span id="narcotics">narcotics</span> is the dearth of hard data. While drug-trafficking organizations often maintain scrupulous records of their transactions, they have a pronounced disincentive to open these books to outsiders. And for a variety of reasons, the media, the counterdrug law-enforcement establishment, and elected political leaders all have incentives to overplay the problem.</p>

                                <p>In a dismayingly typical scenario, drug warriors will fill this information vacuum by conjuring up back-of-the-envelope figures, which the press will then gleefully repeat—at which point, the drug warriors will seek a budget increase, citing the press account, which has now accorded their data points the aura of established fact. (This configuration of mutually affirming incentives is sometimes described—by federal bureaucrats who are clear-eyed enough to admit it—as a self-licking ice cream cone.)</p>

                                <p>If there is fog in the drug war, there is more still in the actual armed conflagration that has consumed <span class="location" id="Syria">Syria</span>, which is now entering its fifth year. And the violent fluidity of this conflict makes it all the more difficult to assess a wave of reports over the past several years about the significance of a little pill known as <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span>—an <span id="amphetamine">amphetamine</span> that is said to play a significant part in the <span id="civil war">civil war</span>.</p>

The <span id="WashingtonPost"><i>Washington Post</i></span> says <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> is “fueling <span class="location" id="Syria">Syria</span>’s war and turning fighters into superhuman soldiers.”1 According to other reports, the gunmen in the terrorist attack on <span class="location" id="Paris">Paris</span> last <span id="November">November</span> had used the pills, which might explain what some observers described as their relentless, “zombie-like” focus during the assault.2 A series of alarming news stories have described the drug as a form of “chemical courage,”3 instilling those who take it with incredible strength and endurance, and the coldly robotic, fearless detachment that allows them to engage in a murderous rampage.</p>

The <span id="drug">drug</span> is no longer manufactured under license, but it is still very widely produced, and variants of it can contain <span id="amphetamine">amphetamine</span> and <span id="caffeine">caffeine</span>, and sometimes also—reportedly—<span id="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</span> and <span id="ephedrine">ephedrine</span>.4 Like any <span id="amphetamine">amphetamine</span>, <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> boosts your energy and can increase your focus and help you to stay awake for long periods of time. It can also create a feeling of euphoria.</p>

                                <p>What is curious about these reports is that, in terms of its chemical composition, <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> does not appear to be able to deliver these superhuman properties. Rather, it resembles other <span id="amphetamines">amphetamines</span>s that are widely used by American college kids with attention <span id="ADHD">deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</span>. It is considerably weaker, in fact, than a drug like <span id="Adderall">Adderall</span>.</p>

                                <p>Furthermore, according to <span id="France 24"><i>France 24</i></span>, the reports about the <span id="ParisAttackers">Paris attackers</span> using <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> proved to be erroneous.7 A toxicology report demonstrated that none of the participants in the attacks were drugged. (The report found faint traces of <span id="cannabis">cannabis</span> and <span id="alcohol">alcohol</span> in the blood of two of the attackers, but the amounts were small enough that they would likely not have been ingested on the day of the attack.)</p>

                                <p>So how do we explain these reports? Is this an instance in which a sensationalist press is quick to recycle hysterical stories with no basis in reality? One interesting possible answer comes from <span id="CarlHart">Carl Hart</span>, a professor of psychiatry at <span class="location" id="Columbia">Columbia</span> who is an expert on <span id="drugabuse">drug abuse</span>. In reconciling the relatively weak chemical properties of the drug with the outsized claims made by those who have taken it, <span id="Carl Hart">Hart</span> says, “The people who think they’re feeling this way must have been told they’re taking <span id="SupermanPills">Superman pills</span>.

                                <p>This would make sense: militaries around the world have supplied their soldiers with various chemical stimulants. The <span id="Nazis">Nazis</span> distributed millions of <span id="amphetamine">amphetamine</span> pills during <span id="WorldWarII">World War II</span>.9 The <span id="USAirForce">U.S. Air Force</span> still provides so-called <span id="gopills">“go pills”</span> to pilots so that they can remain awake on long flights.

                                <p>But there’s another interesting aspect to this theory: it’s not only the brigade leader who has an incentive to overplay the effects of the <span id="drug">drug</span>, but the manufacturer, as well. A man who produces <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span> at a factory in <span class="location" id="Lebanon">Lebanon</span>’s <span class="location" id="BekaaValley">Bekaa Valley</span> and sells it to <span id="ISIL">ISIL</span> fighters told <span id="NewYorkMagazine"><i>New York</i></span>, “If you shoot someone on <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span>, they don’t feel it. And if someone takes many pills, like 30 or so, they become violent and crazy, paranoid, unafraid of anything.”12 If militants in <span class="location" id="Syria">Syria</span> are indeed taking thirty pills at a time, they may well be experiencing unintended side-effects, but <i>of course</i> the manufacturer would be overselling the product (not to mention suggesting a colossal dosage). Informed that doctors doubt <span id="Captagon">Captagon</span>’s ability to produce the effects he is describing, the manufacturer responds, “Doctors are stupid.

Given what's at stake, should soldiers be pumped full ofdrugs to help them reach their peak, and to what extent is this alreadyhappening?</p>
                                <p>With his admission to what was dubbed as sport’smost widespread doping regime in history, LanceArmstrong unwittingly blew the lid on the greatlengths athletes will go to in order to gain anadvantage over their opponents. Pumped full of <span id="EPO">EPO</span> and oxygen-infused blood, Armstrong left othercyclists in his wake as he cruised to seven <span id="TourFrance">Tour de France</span> titles.</p>
                                <p>While using performance enhancing drugs to gain anunfair advantage over rivals considered to becompeting clean obviously defeats the object of thecontest, the presence of such substances opens thecurious debate regarding their validity outside of thesporting world. Surgeons, requiring a cool head and asteady hand, have long been known to usemedications designed to steady nerves. If this potentially saves lives, then surely the use of these medications is warranted?</p>
                                <p>If this is indeed the case, then how far does this extend into the unique circumstances associated with military action? War fighters are generallytasked with protecting a perceived greater good, andtheir success or failure can significantly impact thelives of innocent civilians.

                                <h3>Pilots on ‘Go Pills’</h3>

                                <h3>“US pilots became involved in a friendly fireincident over <span class="location" id="Tarnak Farms">Tarnak Farms</span>, <span class="location" id="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</span>, whileunder the influence of <span id="Dexedrine">Dexedrine</span>.”</h3>

                                <p>US Air Force pilots’ use of amphetamines is one ofthe most widely documented examples of the use of performance enhancing drugs by military personnel. Often tasked with conducting excessively longmissions – some lasting upwards of 20 hours – US Department of Defense scientists began to issue dextroamphetamines – more commonly known as <span id="Speed">‘Speed’</span>, but referred to as ‘Go Pills’ within the USAF – to its pilots to ensure they remained alert long after tiredness and fatigue should have started to impingeon mental performance.</p>
                                <p>Although the benefits of such drugs have been rendered ideal, the side effects, including confusion, delusions, auditory hallucinations, aggression and, inextreme cases, psychotic behaviour, represent adisposition that is hardly ideal for a person in charge of a multimillion-dollar war machine. This is best evidenced by an incident in <span id="April2002">April 2002</span>, in which US pilots became involved in a friendly fire incident over <span class="location" id="TarnakFarms">Tarnak Farms</span>, <span class="location" id="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</span>, while under the influence of <span id="Dexedrine">Dexedrine</span>. Four Canadian soldiers died in the accident.</p>
                                <p>The air force does not hide away from the use of such <span id="Amphetamines">amphetamines</span>, and has publicly disclosed the prescription of small doses – often 10mg – of <span id="Dexedrine">Dexedrine</span> if “fatigue could be expected to degrade air crew performance.” While the <span id="USAF">USAF</span> is quick to insist that the use of such medications is voluntary and consent forms must be signed by pilots, the formalso notes that pilots can be grounded if they decline. Pilot groundings, no matter the circumstances, canhave serious implications on a pilot’s career,potentially leading to a perverse situation where a pilot could almost feel forced to take the drugs.</p>

                                <h3>Banned by <span id="WADA">WADA</span>, sought by the army</h3>

                                <p>The US Army sought to follow the <span id="USAF">USAF</span>’s lead regarding the use of performance enhancing drugs by investigating <span id="Dimethylamine">Dimethylamine (DMAA)</span>, aperformance enhancing supplement registered onthe <span id="WorldAnti-DopingAgency">World Anti-Doping Agency</span>’s banned substance list. Investigations were under way until the supplement was pulled from the shelves, having been linked with the deaths of two soldiers in <span id="December2011">December 2011</span> while undergoing a routine training drill.</p>
                                <p>Supplements containing <span id="Dimethylamine">DMAA</span> grew in popularitydue to their premise of increasing stamina and performance, particularly in preparation for gruelling physical challenges. The drug captured headlines inthe <span class="location" id="UK">UK</span> after it was linked to the death of 30-year old <span id="ClaireSquires">Claire Squires</span>, who died of cardiac failure having run 25 miles of the 26.2 mile <span id="LondonMarathon">London Marathon</span> course. The <span id="USArmy">US Army</span> continues to dispute the drug’s links to the death of the soldiers, perhaps alarmingly citing that “the use and safety of these stimulant productsremains matters of intense interest to theDepartment of Defense.</p>

                                <h3>”Peak Soldier Performance Programme</h3>

                                <p>The comments regarding the US <span id="DoD">DoD</span>’s interest in stimulants harks back to <span id="DARPA">DARPA</span>’s <span id="PeakSoldierPerformanceProgramme">Peak Soldier Performance Programme</span>, which in <span id="2004">2004</span> sought a biochemical approach that would allow a soldier to operate in theatre for up to five days without requiring sustenance. In pursuit of this, no stone or genome was left unturned.</p>

                                <h3>“The air force does not hide away from the useof such amphetamines, and has publicly disclosed the prescription of small doses.</h3>

                                <p>”<span id="DARPA">DARPA</span>’s approach included investigations into endurance-building nutrients that could be taken in the lead-up to deployment, while also lowering a soldier’s core temperature and boosting his or hermitochondria. Mitochondria are effectively a cell’spower supply, fuelling it by converting sugars into chemical energy. <span id="OxfordUniversity">Oxford University</span> biochemists sought ways in which mitochondria could be altered genetically to have them feed off fat-based ketones, leading to much smaller, ketone-based rations being capable of not only keeping soldiers on their feet, buthaving them operate at their peak for days at a time. Initial laboratory tests demonstrated that rats given the treatment were able to run for extended periods of time.</p>
                                <p>Other approaches include altering a soldier’s metabolism to reduce the need to feed, lowering body temperatures during strenuous activities, sothat less energy was exerted, and even caffeinated gum, which would provide a quick energy boost intimes of dire need, was experimented with. The idea,as one <span id="DARPA">DARPA</span> official informed <span id="Wired">Wired</span>, was not to create <span id="Supermen">Supermen</span>, but to make it so that “these kids could perform at their peak, stay at their peak, andcome home to their families.</p>

                                <h3>”An ethical dilemma“</h3>

                                <h3>The report alluded to the potential development of drugs that could suppress thefear and inhibition of soldiers.</h3>

                                <p>”The notion of creating <span id="Supermen">Supermen</span> poses an obvious ethical dilemma, and the office of US President <span id="GeorgeBush">George W. Bush</span> responded by issuing the <span id="2003">2003</span> report ‘Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness’, which referenced issues concerned with the use of performance enhancing drugs and treatments.</p>
                                <p>The report alluded to discussions regarding memory-blunting drugs that could be issued to soldiers to prevent mental scarring or occurrences of <span id="PTSD">Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</span> after combat operations, providing they demonstrated efficacy intesting, but focused upon the unique circumstancesof war, rubbishing any comparison to pursuits where <span id="PED">PED</span>s are outlawed, such as professional sports.</p>
                                <p>“What guidance, if any, does our analysis provide for such moments of extreme peril and consequence...when superior performance is a matter of life and death?” the report asked, adding: “There may indeed be times when we must override certain limits or prohibitions that make sense in other contexts.</p>
                                <p>”Sections of the report continued in the same vein, confirming attitudes shared by US decision makers that in the grand scheme of ethics, the demands of war may transcend what would otherwise be commonly acceptable. “When we override our own boundaries, we do so or should do so for the sake ofthe whole, and only when the whole itself is at stake, when everything human and humanly dignified maybe lost.</p>

                                <h3>”Men remaining human</h3>

                                <p>The report did, however, insist that physical advancements owing to drugs must only go so far, even in extreme circumstances, emphasising great importance on the notion of “men remaining human even in moments of great crisis.” The report alluded to the potential development of drugs that could suppress the fear and inhibition of soldiers, effectively turning them into killing machines capable of acting without both scrutiny andimpunity.</p>
                                <p>Given the clamour from agencies including the <span id="USArmy">US Army</span>, <span id="USAirForce">US Air Force</span> and <span id="DARPA">DARPA</span> to instigate research into and the explicit use of pharmaceuticals capable of enhancing performance, it must be considered a matter of when, rather than if soldiers are issued with such drugs. A new age arms race could soon be launched, with the limits of human capabilities, rather than human intelligence and ingenuity, the new battleground.</p>
                                <p>Budget cuts and financial implications haverestricted the number of active, retained servicemen, so it is perhaps a predictable practice to ensure that these remaining soldiers are given every possible advantage to ensure national security. With reports issued by the US purposefully vague as to what is deemed an acceptable limit however, it remains to beseen just how advanced soldiers could become.</p>
