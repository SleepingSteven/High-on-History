    High on History is a MMMM (Mixing Maps, Magazines and Metadata) project developed to transform reading into a virtual time-travelling experience across past and future typography trends. Nine articles related to the topic of the usage of drugs in warfare are displayed in three issues of the magazine. The articles are organised in issues according to the time period they relate to. The issues are "Antiquity", "The Two World Wars" and "Contemporaneity". Each article is geo-referenced and its metadata are accessible to the user.

<h2>
    Early sixteenth century
</h2>

<p>
    For the general layout of the page, the inspiring document was 
    "Chapter 24 - The Emergence of Modern Printing Technique" in Guity Novin's History of Graphic Design. 
    Overall, the webpage aims to resemble the publication of Historia Florentina (1478) by Poggio Bracciolini. 
    The font chosen is Garamond, that owes its name and style to the design of the typeface designer and punch-cutter Claude Garamond (ca. 1480–1561). Italics is used because it is an invention belonging to the European Reinassance, and the colour red of the first word of each paragraph is a feature that appears in the book "Qvesta opra da ogni parte e un libro doro" (1476), by Johannes Müller von Königsberg. The border is also inspired by an edition of Aristotle (1495-98) by the prominent Venetian publisher and printer Aldus Manutius.

<h2>
    Nineteenth century
</h2>

<p>
    The webpage aims to resemble a publication of the Nineteenth century, which is why the chosen font is Bodoni. Indeed, Bodoni owes its name and style to the Italian printer Giambattista Bodoni (1740-1813), who designed several modern typefaces between the end of the Eighteenth century and the beginning of the Nineteenth.
    However, the headlines of the text are displayed in the font "Trinigan", which aims to resemble the labels on the old cigar boxes displayed in "   Chapter 25 - Pioneers of the Art Nouveau, Chromolithography and the emergence of the modern poster and cigar box labels" in Guity Novin's History of Graphic Design. 
    The colours of the page are also inspired by the cigar box labels of the late Nineteenth century, whereas the border of the page was chosen as a typical expression of Art Nouveau in publications at that time, as shown in "Chapter 64 - A History of Magazine Covers" in Guity Novin's History of Graphic Design.
